            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as the Creation, ſo alſo the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Man-kind was here wrought, by our Bleſſed Saviour's Incarnation, Nativity, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Miracles, and laſtly, Suffering upon the Croſs, and Reſurrection: And here the Divine Monument of his Paſſion, the Holy Sepulchre, is yet preſerv'd, by God's Providence, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guardianſhip of <hi>Infidels</hi> themſelves. From hence, as from the Fountain of Plantation, and firſt Inhabited Part of the World, <hi>Colonies</hi> were ſent forth into all Parts, and the whole Globe of Earth was ſupply'd with People. Here was the firſt Foundation of Cities, Inſtitution of Laws and Government, Civiliſing of Manners, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Arts and Sciences, and the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Literature, both Divine and Humane, to the reſt of the World. And as the two firſt Great and Famous Empires of the World, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Perſian,</hi> were here Founded, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded each other, continuing for the ſpace of 1368 Years, namely, from the Year of the World 2000, to the Year 3368; ſo at this day the greateſt Empires of the Univerſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Part thereof; as namely, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, which though it extend it ſelf into <hi>Europe,</hi> yet the greateſt part of it is contain'd within the Verge of <hi>Aſia;</hi> that of the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia;</hi> that of the Emperor of <hi>China;</hi> that of the <hi>Great Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary;</hi> which two laſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires are now by Conqueſt united under one Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Great Chan:</hi> and that of the <hi>Great Mogol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Seven Wonders of the World, Four were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> namely, The Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> The <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> or Sepulchre of <hi>Mauſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> at <hi>Halicarnaſſus;</hi> The Walls of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> or Statue of the Sun, at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Of the other three, one is in <hi>Europe, viz.</hi> The Statue of <hi>Olympick Jupiter;</hi> the other two are in <hi>Africa, viz.</hi> The <hi>Pharos</hi> or Watch-Tower, and the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Pyramids.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphrates</hi> riſeth in <hi>Great Armenia,</hi> and is call'd by the Inhabitants generally <hi>Phrat:</hi> But in its Progreſs through ſeveral Countries, it changeth its Name; for, ſome ſpace from its firſt riſing it is call'd <hi>Pyxirates;</hi> towards its entrance into the Mountain <hi>Taurus, Omira;</hi> again, coming forth from out of the ſaid Mountain, it takes the Name of <hi>Euphrates;</hi> afterwards it toucheth upon <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> on the Left Hand, and <hi>Syria, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia</hi> on the Right, and then divides it ſelf into ſeveral Arms, one whereof takes its Courſe to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and falls into the River <hi>Tigris;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther runs through <hi>Babylon,</hi> and loſeth it ſelf in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lakes of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> but afterwards ſhoots it ſelf forth again, and from thenceforth anciently it ran directly towards the Sea, where it diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogu'd it ſelf with a great Mouth; but ſince, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Courſe ſtopt by the People thereabout, for the fertiliſing of the Ground, it was forc'd to take its way through the <hi>Tigris</hi> again. This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſwelling like <hi>Nilus</hi> in ſome places, uſeth to overflow the Fields of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and make them very Fruitful.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Tigris,</hi> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Tigil,</hi> in like manner hath its Source in <hi>Great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> in a plain Champaign place. There where this River runs with a ſlow gentle Stream, it is call'd <hi>Diglito;</hi> where it carried with a ſwift pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitous Courſe, <hi>Tigris,</hi> which in the <hi>Median</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſignifies <hi>A Dart.</hi> It breaks through the Lake <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> and a little after, the Mountain <hi>Taurus</hi> hindring its Courſe, makes it ſelf a hidden way under Ground, and riſes on the other ſide of the Mountain; then having pierc'd through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lake nam'd <hi>Thoſpites,</hi> ſinks again under Ground, and with another Subterranean Courſe meaſures ſix <hi>German</hi> Miles. After it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in other Rivers in <hi>Aſsyria</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates <hi>Aſſyria</hi> from <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and at <hi>Seleucia</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:63517:7"/>divided into two Branches, one whereof glides to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and the other to <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and ſo makes, as it were, an Iſland, though of no great Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: As ſoon as its Streams conjoyn into one again, it is call'd <hi>Paſitygris.</hi> At length it inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into a Lake of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> out of which having broken forth with great violence, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to the <hi>Perſian Gulph,</hi> in which it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates with two Out-lets.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Jordan</hi> ſprings from two Fountains, though not far diſtant frnm each other, the one of them nam'd <hi>Jor,</hi> the other <hi>Dan,</hi> of the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which two Words is fram'd the Name of <hi>Jordan.</hi> This River is extremely pleaſant and beautiful in its Proſpect: About twelve Miles from its Source it runs into the Lake <hi>Samochonites,</hi> thence into the Lake <hi>Geneſara,</hi> or <hi>Tiberias;</hi> after which it waters <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Samaria;</hi> and laſtly, is immerſt into the Lake <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> or <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> in the way making ſeveral Turnings and Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as if loth to loſe it ſelf and its ſweet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſuch a noiſom Sea.</p>
               <p>In <hi>India</hi> are two moſt Noble Rivers, <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges. Indus,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Hiind,</hi> or <hi>Inder,</hi> riſing from the Mountain <hi>Parapomiſus,</hi> takes in nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Rivers, whereof the Chief are <hi>Hydaſpis</hi> and <hi>Hypaſus.</hi> The greateſt Breadth of this River is fifty Furlongs, and the Depth of it fifteen Paces: With ſeven Mouths it empties it ſelf into the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ganges</hi> (now <hi>Guengam</hi>) ariſeth out of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Mountains, affords in many places very rich Pearl, and plenty of Gold-duſt. The leaſt Breadth of this River is ſaid to be two <hi>German</hi> Miles, and its leaſt Depth 100 Foot.</p>
               <p>The grand Rivers of <hi>Tartaria Aſiatica</hi> are <hi>Ob,</hi> and <hi>Parapomiſus,</hi> now <hi>Orchardus;</hi> both which fall into the <hi>Northern Ocean: Rha,</hi> now <hi>Volga; Jax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artes,</hi> now <hi>Cheſel;</hi> and the River <hi>Edel,</hi> which diſgorge into the <hi>Hircanian Sea.</hi> Of <hi>Perſia, Oxus,</hi> now <hi>Abia,</hi> or <hi>Abiamu; Arbis,</hi> now <hi>Ilment;</hi> and <hi>Samydaces.</hi> Not to omit in <hi>Media</hi> the Rivers <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Cambyſes, Amardus, Strato,</hi> and <hi>Corindas:</hi> Of <hi>China, Cantao</hi>

            <p>This Kingdom, partly by Inteſtine Wars, and partly by the Invaſion of Forein Princes, was ſo much abated in its former Splendor, that the Inhabitants thereof were abſolutely enſlav'd, and after the <hi>Arabians</hi> had Conquer'd them, forc'd to deny their Name, and from that time forward were not permitted to ſtyle themſelves <hi>Perſians,</hi> but <hi>Saracens.</hi> Not long after which it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and firſt brought under Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Chinguis Chan,</hi> and then under <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane;</hi> yet at length it began again to flouriſh, and regain'd much of its ancient Luſtre in the laſt Age, by the Valour of <hi>Iſmael Sefi,</hi> and is now rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd amongſt the moſt powerful Monarchies of the Eaſt.</p>

               <hi>Olearius,</hi> from his obſervation of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Maps, makes <hi>Perſia</hi> to extend (taking in all the circumjacent ſubdu'd Provinces) from the North to the South, from the <hi>Caſpian Sea</hi> to the Bay of <hi>Perſia;</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt, from the Borders of <hi>Candahar</hi> to the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> or <hi>Moratſu;</hi> nay, it extends half way on the Weſt ſide, from the <hi>Caſpian Sea</hi> upward, to the <hi>Armenian</hi> Mountains; and Eaſtward towards the River <hi>Ruth Chane,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Oxun;</hi> on the North ſide whereof dwell the <hi>Usbeki</hi> and <hi>Bucharian Tartars,</hi> who partly pay Tribute to the <hi>Perſians.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Maginus</hi> makes <hi>Perſia</hi> extend from Eaſt to Weſt 38 Degrees, becauſe its Longitude from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> is in 82 Degrees, and the moſt Eaſtern in 129. but from the North to the South, to 20 Degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 23. to the 43.

            <p>According to <hi>Cluverius</hi> and <hi>Golnitius,</hi> it makes out the ſame length, reckoning from <hi>Araxis</hi> to the River <hi>Indus,</hi> a thouſand eight hundred and forty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles and the breadth, from <hi>Oxus</hi> to the <hi>Perſian Sea,</hi> eight hundred and ten.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Olearius</hi> confutes all theſe Writers in this Point, and affirms, That <hi>Perſia</hi> hath 12 Degrees in breadth from North to South; for if you take the utmoſt Limits or Corners which lie at both the oppoſite Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Caſpian Sea</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gulf,</hi> you will find that the City <hi>Haſum,</hi> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Reſht,</hi> is ſituate ſcarce two Leagues from the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> under 37 Deg. and <hi>Ormus</hi> at the <hi>Perſian Gulf</hi> in 25 Degrees; ſo that the extent of this breadth is but 12 Degrees, a Tract of two hundred and eighty <hi>German</hi> Miles.</p>

               <p>Some, but eſpecially <hi>Philips</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> would have <hi>Sciras</hi> to be the ancient City <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> or at leaſt that <hi>Sciras</hi> was built out of its Ruins on the ſame Foundation: but this is a grand Miſtake, becauſe <hi>Schiras</hi> is not an ancient City, and the Place where <hi>Perſepolis</hi> ſtood, is above ten <hi>Perſian</hi> Miles to the Northward from <hi>Schiras:</hi> Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> affirms, that <hi>Schiras</hi> was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the Ruins of <hi>Perſepolis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some aſcribe the building of this City to <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhid,</hi> fifth King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who (as the Chronicle makes mention) was succeeded by <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> not long after the Death of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Botterus</hi> tells us, That <hi>Schiras</hi> was built when <hi>Grand-Cair</hi> was but a Village; but according to the Regiſters of the Country, it was built not above ſeven hundred and fifty years ago, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after the <hi>Arabians</hi> made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Moreover, if ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be credited, which are there certainly believ'd, this City is much elder, eſpecially if it be true what is related of an <hi>Aſian</hi> General call'd <hi>Jenpſit,</hi> who is ſaid to have liv'd many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Account of Time: And though they differ amongſt themſelves in the Time and Reign of the foremention'd Heroe, yet 'tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he liv'd a thouſand years after the <hi>Flood.</hi> They affirm that he was the Perſon who made the great and ſtrange cut Channel, which ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly waters the whole Country of <hi>Schiras,</hi> by undermining and cutting through the great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that lie between the City and Springs, and thereby brought them to their preſent Perfection; and by this means they furniſh the City with ſuch an abundance of Water, that if all the Channels were cut into one, they would make a very large River.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Schiras,</hi> lying in 28 Degrees and 44 Minutes Northern Latitude, is ſituate about ten Leagues from the Ruins of <hi>Perſepolis;</hi> near the Stream <hi>Bendamir</hi> or <hi>Bendimir,</hi> on a great Plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd with Mountains (except on the ſide where you go over a Bridge from <hi>Paſa</hi> into the ſame) two Leagues diſtant from the City, but on the North ſcarce half a League.</p>
               <p>This City was formerly much bigger, and had many more magnificent Buildings than at this day, as plainly appears both within and without its Walls: And the <hi>Arabian</hi> Geographer <hi>Ulug Becig,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> affirms that it was in his Time three Leagues and a half in Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The like bigneſs <hi>Contaſing</hi> aſcribes to the ſame, as alſo the number of twenty four thouſand Houses.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Age <hi>Schach Abbas,</hi> to puniſh the Inſurrection of one <hi>Jacob Chan,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Lord of <hi>Schiras,</hi> pull'd down that part of the Wall which was then remaining, and fill'd up the Moat and Trench which ſurrounded the City.</p>
               <p>Both without and within the City are many <hi>Moſques</hi> or Temples, amongſt which ſome are built very magnificent and beautiful, and eſpecially one, which being of an extraordinary bigneſs, hath a much higher Steeple upon it than any of the other. Theſe Towers, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> call <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corons,</hi> are narrow, but high, having without two or three Galleries one above another; from whence the <hi>Marabouts</hi> (a ſort of Prieſts) publickly read their Prayers with a loud and ſtrong Voice three times a day, and walking round about the Gallery, that they may be the better underſtood.</p>
               <p>There are very few handſom Structures either without or within the City, except the <hi>Moſques;</hi> for beſides three Royal Palaces, (of which one is in the City, and the other two in the Suburbs) there is not one fair House: 'tis true, that of the <hi>Chan</hi> or <hi>Sultan,</hi> thoug it be not very beautiful on the out-ſide, yet large, and hath many Painted and richly Gilded Apartments within, beſides Galleries, Gardens, Orchards, and pleaſant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63517:12"/>Walks. All the other, inhabited by Citizens and other eminent Perſons, are ſmall and mean; the Rooms, except the Hall and two or three Chambers, are ſo little, that an indifferent Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man here, hath better Accommodation than a Nobleman there.</p>
               <p>The City hath ſeveral Gates, one of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the River <hi>Paſargadas,</hi> and is call'd <hi>Darva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za Paſa,</hi> that is, <hi>The Gate of Paſa,</hi> anciently <hi>Paſarga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> it is very little, and ſupported only by the Relicks of an old Mud Wall. Oppoſite to this Gate, towards the Weſt, is another call'd <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaza Achem,</hi> that is, <hi>Iron Gate,</hi> at which begins a very fair Street above 2000 Paces long, and every where exactly 90 Paces broad. On each ſide of this Street is a Wall of about ſixteen Foot high, Plaiſter'd over with Mortar, and without any Houſes; behind are ſpacious Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, full of Fruit-trees and curious Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes, which belong to the King, and are neatly built, with large Galleries and pleaſant Proſpects.</p>
               <p>In this fair Street the <hi>Perſians</hi> run Races, and perform their Exerciſes on Horſeback. At the end of the Streets ſtands the King's Palace, very handſomly built, with Balconies and Terrace Walks. Before the Court you aſcend by two Steps to a little Plain, which is rais'd higher than the Street. At the Entrance, and near the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, in the midſt of the Plain, lies a fair and large Pool of Water.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Inhabitants of the City appear every Friday, being the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Sabbath, in a ſpacious Plain, both on Foot and Horſeback, and are there Exercis'd and Train'd, and afterwards diſpoſe themſelves to other Recreations as they think fit.</p>
               <p>Near the King's Palace is a fair Houſe with a pleaſant Garden, the Work of the Great <hi>Iſmael Sofi,</hi> very curiouſly built three Stories high; in the ſecond of which, among other very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Apartments, is a large and ſpacious Hall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the middle an Arch'd <hi>Lover,</hi> full of Glaſs Windows. In this Apartment, as alſo in the reſt on this Story, are divers Pictures of Women, moſt of them Cloth'd after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>Under the Galleries which ſurround this Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, two are much bigger than the other; one of which being over the Gate looks into the Street, and alſo to that Gate of the City which is call'd <hi>Darvaza Paſa.</hi> The other ſtanding above the firſt, is over the Gate, through which you paſs to go into the Garden, and reſpects the Weſt. Each of theſe have three Doors one againſt another, ſo that being in the Hall, which is in the middle of the Edifice, you have the Proſpect not only of the foremention'd Streets and Walks, but alſo of the City Gate, and that of the <hi>Haram</hi> or <hi>Seraglio,</hi> in the middle of the Garden, which may juſtly be accounted a Wood of all ſorts of Fruit-trees, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Walks, but thoſe of the Cypreſs and Palm are the chiefeſt, which begin at the Court Gate, and extend nine hundred Paces in length, and thirty in breadth; the Walks are very ſtraight and even Planted on both ſides with tall Cypreſs-trees, which are ſo big that three Men can ſcarce fathom them, and ſo high and ſtraight, that they repreſent great Obelisks. At the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Trees is rais'd a Gravel Path or Bank, ſomewhat higher than the middle Walk, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix Foot broad, where all People walk; for they go not into the middle part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that muſt be kept always green. At the bottom of theſe Cypreſs-trees, on the out-ſide of the Walk, runs a pleaſant Brook, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dividing it ſelf into ſeveral Branches, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all parts of the Garden. At the end of the Walk is the <hi>Haram</hi> or <hi>Seraglio,</hi> built after the ſame manner as the Houſe before mention'd, but not ſo large nor high: It is erected on a Plain rais'd ſeven Foot higher than the Garden. On each ſide of this Structure is forty Foot of Ground, in which are ten eight-ſquare Ponds, which are each half a Fathom deep, to ſerve the Houſe with Water. This Edifice is not cover'd with Tyles, but with Lome and chopt Straw or Chaff, which being temper'd together and bak'd, becomes ſo hard that no Water will ſoke through, but runs off into Gutters join'd to the Wells. On this Roof, as alſo on thoſe of all other Houſes, ſtands a Marble Pillar of about three or four Foot long, and one thick. On the top of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> you have a Proſpect of the whole Garden, as alſo a cool walking-place in the hot Summer Nights.</p>
               <p>This Garden affords all ſorts of <hi>European</hi> Fruits, but eſpecially Pears, and Grapes of divers ſorts, beautiful to the Eye, and very large; alſo Piſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's, Almonds, and Filberds.</p>
               <p>Sixty or ſeventy Paces from the <hi>Haram</hi> appears a ſquare Fountain, with a handſom Aſcent; each Square is about a hundred Foot long, and Wall'd with Marble; alſo fill'd with Water, in which are kept two Pleaſure-boats for the Women to recreate themſelves with.</p>
               <p>All the Walks are on both ſides Hedg'd in with <hi>Province</hi>-Roſes, out of which they Diſtill abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Roſe-water, and ſend it in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and other remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>In this large Garden are abundance of great Pheaſants, Woodcocks, and other Fowls, which are there as in a Cage, breeding and hatching up their Young.</p>
               <p>Ten Leagues from <hi>Schiras</hi> is a Village call'd <hi>Maragaskan,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Mardaſh;</hi> it lies in 28 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 48 Minutes Northern Latitude, four League North-Weſt from the Village <hi>Mahin;</hi> between which the Way is very ſtraight, pleaſant, and delightful, being overgrown with Grass. This Village contains about two hundred Houſes, ſo inclos'd with Trees, that at a diſtance it appears to be a Wood divided into ſeveral ſmall Parks. The Air thereabouts is very temperate, and the Water good and freſh, beſides which all ſorts of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very cheap.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Mardaſh,</hi> at the end of a neighboring Plain, nigh the Foot of a high Mountain not far from the Brook <hi>Sirt,</hi> may be ſeen the Ruins of an old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Tzehilminar,</hi> that is, <hi>Forty Towers,</hi> though at this Day only thirty of them remain, <hi>viz.</hi> nineteen high ones, and eleven broken ones; but (as <hi>Della Valle</hi> affirms) there are not above twenty, which may be true, and the Place not miſnam'd; for though now ſo few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, without doubt there were more at firſt, the <hi>Perſian</hi> word <hi>Thehil</hi> ſignifying <hi>Fort,</hi> and <hi>Minar A Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph Barbaro</hi> affirms, that the Towers before mention'd are as big as three Men can Fathom, and (as <hi>Mandeſlo</hi> relates) conſiſts of black and white Marble.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> relate, that this Edifice was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63517:12"/>by a King call'd <hi>Tzemſhied Schach,</hi> famous for Wiſdom; but <hi>Olearius</hi> queſtions that. Others ſay That King <hi>Solomon</hi> built it: and ſome believe that <hi>Darius</hi> was the Founder thereof, and that <hi>Iskander,</hi> which is <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> ruin'd it: But <hi>Aelian</hi> aſcribes the erecting thereof to King <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Foundation or Platform of this Structure is about eighty Yards, being cut out of an intire Rock of Marble: They aſcend the ſame on four pair of Stairs, conſiſting of ninety five Steps; cut out of white Marble: On the top, not far from the Stairs, appear four Pieces of a broken Wall, that ſeem to have been two large Gates; on the firſt two are cut two great Horſes, with ſtrange Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and on the other two are other kind of Beaſts, with Bodies like Horſes, but Heads like Lyons with Crowns upon them, and Wings at their Shoulders. Not far from hence, on the right ſide, ſtand the thirty foremention'd Pillars. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtant from theſe Towers, and ſomewhat higher were two indifferent large Chambers, of which are remaining ſome of the Doors and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which are of Marble, as alſo the Walls, which are ſo poliſh'd, that one may ſee their Face therein as in a Looking-Glaſs. Farther in, on the ſide near the Doors, are all manner of ancient Shapes and Figures, hewn in Stone, and bigger than the Life, ſome ſitting, others ſtanding, with long Hair, broad Beards, and long Coats down to their Feet, with wide Sleeves, a Saſh about their Middle, and ſtrange round Caps on their Heads. Not far from theſe Chambers ſtands a ſquare Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with a great poliſh'd Stone in the top, which ſome judge to be a Jaſper; on this alſo, as on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Columns, are ſtrange Characters En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven which none can Read.</p>
               <p>All that remains of the Relicks or Ruins of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Perſepolis</hi> we find very well deſcrib'd in Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> wherefore we ſhall give you the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in his following words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Ribs or Ruins of <hi>Perſepolis</hi> (ſaith he) are at this Day call'd <hi>Chill-Manor,</hi> or <hi>Chehel-Manor,</hi> that is, <hi>Forty Towers</hi> in the Idiom of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and might more properly have ſaid <hi>Haſhtot-Manor,</hi> or <hi>Eighty Towers,</hi> for ſo many are eaſily told two Yards out of the Ground; and if from ſo many Pillars as are perfect and lofty, then may they ſay <hi>Nouzda-Manor,</hi> or <hi>Nineteen Towers,</hi> at this Day no more ſtanding, one excepted at the Eaſt below, above a Bowe-ſhot thence. The whole Baſis is cut by incredible toil out of the ſolid Marble Rock, twice the compaſs of <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, aſcended by fourſcore and fifteen eaſie Steps, diſſected from the durable black Marble, ſo broad that a dozen Horſes may go abreaſt: the Perpendicular is two and twenty Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Feet, and where the Stairs are not, the Rock is precipitious: near the higheſt Step is the Entrance into the Palate; the Breadth is viſible, in deſpight of Flame and Weather: on one ſide of the Gate ſtands a monſtrous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is about twenty Foot; the Portraicts are cut out of the ſhining Marble, ten Yards high either of them, fixt and perpetual. A few Paces thence are of like Work, Bulk, and Matter, two gallant Towers; and (to finiſh the Porter's Lodge) near them is another Ruine, a <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> an Invention of the Sculptor to illuſtrate his Art: And being paſt this Portal, the <hi>Apollo</hi> opens, a fair even Ground, deplorable in many Ruins, a hundred white Marble Pillars, whole and broken, dignifying this once moſt excellent Structure. Upon many of theſe white Marble Pillars the Storks have builded their Neſts, where the rage of Wind and Weather is more offenſive to them than any dread they have of the People who inhabit near them. In all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, ſtormy, or cold Weather, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Region, and fly where the Sun can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them. The <hi>Perſians</hi> have many ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stories concerning them, and ſuppoſe them (as elſe-where I have noted) the Emblems of Piety and Gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day ſtanding (but ſeem to groan under the Tyranny of Time) are betwixt fifteen and twenty Cubits, and riſe beautifully in forty Squares or concave Parallels, every Square ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving full three Inches, whereby the Circuit may be gather'd. Moſt excellent is the Matter, moſt elegant the Work, and no leſs commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Order and Shape how they are plac'd; in poſture and ſhew to this day admirable; but when they ſtood in luſtre and perfection, were elſewhere ſcarce imitable. From the ordinary ſtanding, we eaſily enjoy'd a moſt delightful Proſpect; but in the Summity or Advantage, a brave Horizon of thirty Miles unlimited Plains, every way gave it ſelf to this Imperial Palace, as ſeeming to ſubmit it ſelf in a happy lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>In part of this great Room (not far from the Portal) in a Mirror of poliſh'd Marble, we noted above a dozen Lines of ſtrange Characters, very fair, and apparent to the Eye; but ſo myſtical, ſo odly fram'd, as no <hi>Hieroglyphick,</hi> no other deep Conceit can be more difficultly fancied, more adverſe to the Intellect. Theſe conſiſting of Figures Obelisk, Triangular, and Pyramidal, yet in ſuch Symetry and Order as cannot well be call'd Barbarous: Some reſemblance I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſome Words had of the Antique <hi>Greek,</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing out <hi>Ahaſuerus Theos:</hi> And though it have ſmall concordance with the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Letter, yet queſtionleſs to the Inventer it was well known, and peradventure may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal ſome excellent Matter, though to this day wrapt up in the dim Leaves of envious Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Adjoyning this, is another ſquare Room, from Angle to Angle ninety Paces, in circuit three hundred and threeſcore Paces, beautified with eight Doors, four of them being ſix Paces broad, and the other four, three apiece; all eight ſeverally compos'd of ſeven great poliſh'd Marbles, fix'd one upon another; each of which Stones are four Yards long, five Quarters high, and moſt excellently engraven with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Lions, Griffins, Tygers, and Bulls: and in other Places (for the Walls are durable) Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, Hecatombs, Triumphs, Olympick Games, and the like, in very rare Sculpture and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Above each Door is engraven the Idea of a Majeſtick Monarch; his Robe is long, a <hi>Tiara</hi> or <hi>Mithra</hi> on his Head, his Hair very long, and curl'd; in one Hand he holds a Globe, in the other his Scepter: A Garb and Seſſion never us'd by <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes. The ſilly Inhabitants (who made no account of it till of late) name him <hi>Jamſhet,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Samſon,</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> A wonder they leave out <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> their <hi>Hercules,</hi> and as eaſie for invention. A third
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63517:13"/>Chamber conjoyns the laſt we ſpoke of: This (if they lie not that told us ſo) was a <hi>Gynecie,</hi> or Nurſery. It has four unequal Angles; two ſides are ſixty, the other two ſeventy of my largeſt Paces. From that, we iſſued into a fourth Room, two ſides whereof are twenty, and the other two, thirty Paces. The Walls are very eminent in this Chamber, of black ſhining Marble, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places ſo bright and jetty, as we could eaſily view our Reflex, no Steel Mirror comparing with it. In moſt parts the Walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illuſtrated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over Heaps of Stones of valuable Portraictures, we mount towards the moſt lofty part of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where we ſaw the Reſemblances of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout King, adoring his three Deities, the Sun, the Fire, and a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicular Mountain. The other ſide of this high Hill is a Precipice, down which is no deſcending. But whether this Fabrick was <hi>Ionick, Dorick,</hi> or <hi>Corinthiack,</hi> in the perfection, I cannot determine; the Ruins forbid a poſitive Judgment. But ſuch at this day it is, that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Limner in three Months ſpace can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her Excellencies. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is, it is not done, the barbarous People eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day defacing it, and cleaving it aſunder for Grave-ſtones and Benches to ſit upon. Five Miles Weſt from <hi>Chehel-manor</hi> is alſo a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, whom the Illiterate <hi>Perſians</hi> ſay was <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and from him call'd <hi>Nocta-Ruſtan.</hi> I rather judge it the Image of Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had a deſire that after-Ages might think him more than a Man, and his Men more than Monſters, as appear'd in his Conceit to make many Armors big enough for three Men, and ſcatter them in <hi>India,</hi> that the People might not dare to rebell, leſt thoſe <hi>Polyphems</hi> came to laſh them. So far Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Some ſuppoſe this Edifice to have been a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; others, a part of the Royal Court, or a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-place for the Kings: but <hi>Della Valle</hi> inclines to the firſt of theſe Opinions. This Ruine is, in truth, all that is left or the ancient City <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> being burnt by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> to ſatisfie the Humor of his Concubine <hi>Thais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Foot of the Mountains, a League Northward from <hi>Hhehel-manor,</hi> are ſeveral old Images by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Nocſci Roſtam,</hi> that is, <hi>The Figures of Roſtam,</hi> who was an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Perſian Heroe,</hi> for his notable Exploits and great Atchievements, very famous in their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as <hi>Hercules</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſaid to have liv'd in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near theſe are alſo carv'd on a large and ſmooth Rock ſeveral other Statues or Images; one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſitting on Horſe-back, is clad in a long Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a Cap or Bonnet on his Head: In his left Hand he holds a Club, as <hi>Hercules</hi> is uſually repreſented, and in his Right Hand a Ring, which another Horſe-man that is plac'd near him alſo holds, both ſeeming to pull as if they would break it in ſunder. This ſecond Horſe-man is cloath'd almoſt after the ſame manner with the firſt, but is bare-headed, and hath very long Hair. There is alſo in another place a third Horſe-man, accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred after the ſame manner, laying his left Hand on the Hilt of his Sword, his right Hand graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sword of a Foot-man that ſtands before him, threatning as it were another Foot-man, who is bare-headed, and kneeling on one Knee before the Horſe-man.</p>
               <p>Not far from hence are ſeen the Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſeveral Women, of which the Inhabitants relate many Fables, but eſpecially of one, who they ſay was the Miſtreſs of their Renowned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On another ſide of this Rock, which is very ſteep like a Wall, are many Holes like Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, a great diſtance from the Ground, and ſome bigger than others; yet the leaſt are ſo large, that a Man may eaſily lie at length in them: and therefore it is very probable that theſe Holes ſerv'd for Places of Interment for the Dead; for <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> affirms, That the ancient Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> were buried in the Country about <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis,</hi> in Holes cut in high Rocks, into which they were lifted with Engines made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>On another adjacent Mountain there is, as <hi>Della Valle</hi> relates, the Image of a Man call'd <hi>Gemſchid,</hi> (or as others, <hi>Choſcid,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>The Sun</hi>) who is ſaid to have Reign'd a conſiderabe time in <hi>Perſia</hi> before <hi>Cyrus the Great,</hi> and ſtill lives in their Memory, for his great Knowledge in <hi>Necromancy.</hi> Some take this <hi>Gemſcid</hi> to be <hi>Nebuchodonoſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the City <hi>Schiras</hi> lie many Hamlets and Villages, as alſo ſeveral Lordſhips, call'd in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue <hi>Mulk,</hi> that is, <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> which are under one peculiar Family; for the Poſſeſſors thereof hold them not of the King, neither can he take them away.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide of the City, as you go to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> lies a Mountain over which you travel along a Stony Road, through which runs a Stream which waters all the adjacent Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards.</p>
               <p>Three Leagues to the Northward of <hi>Schiras</hi> ſtood a large <hi>Caravanſera,</hi> which though half ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, yet by its great Walls and Arches ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifies its former Magnitude.</p>
               <p>This Province contains four great Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Schiras, viz. Caſirum, Bunitzan, Firuſabath,</hi> and <hi>Aſtar;</hi> as alſo the Towns <hi>Arboy, Chiminar, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Savas,</hi> formerly the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Maſſabates:</hi> It compriſes likewiſe <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusbate, Berdezzil, Senorgande, Cazaran,</hi> by <hi>Texei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> call'd <hi>Carriu,</hi> and by <hi>Ananie, Caſrum;</hi> alſo <hi>Camara, Zemilen, Bendarepe, Seruſtan, Agiane, &amp;c. Texeira</hi> alſo places in this Province theſe Towns and Villages, <hi>viz. Tarum, Iaharom</hi> or <hi>Jarum, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi> or <hi>Laſtan, Stahabanon, Neriz, Pacah, Daragued,</hi> and <hi>Duzgun,</hi> near <hi>Laſtan,</hi> between <hi>Comoron</hi> and the City <hi>Lara,</hi> eighteen Leagues from <hi>Ormus.</hi> There are alſo the Cities of <hi>Rey</hi> and <hi>Gibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt City of this Province, according to <hi>Figueroa,</hi> is <hi>Guin,</hi> as alſo <hi>Benaru,</hi> with the Ruins of the Caſtle <hi>Gabriel,</hi> in the utmoſt Confines of the Kingdom of <hi>Lara;</hi> though both Places lie very near one another, in a great Plain. The City <hi>Guin</hi> is ſeparated from the reſt of <hi>Perſia</hi> by high Mountains, over which you muſt travel to go to <hi>Jarum,</hi> and thence with the <hi>Caravans</hi> through the Deſart.</p>
               <p>It is apparent that this City hath been built many Years, and Peopled by a Colony of <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe the Inhabitants are of a better Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and more Moralliſed than the neighbouring wild <hi>Arabians:</hi> Their Complexion alſo is whiter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63517:13"/>and the Habit of the Women neater and more Civil. On the left Hand going from <hi>Guin</hi> lies a Village call'd <hi>Denia,</hi> full of fair Houſes.</p>
               <p>About two days Journey from <hi>Guin</hi> lies the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City <hi>Horum,</hi> ſo call'd from its Beauty and great plenty of Dates; as alſo another of the ſame denomination, between <hi>Cabreſtan</hi> and <hi>Lara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between <hi>Guin</hi> and <hi>Horum</hi> you meet with a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and uninhabited Deſart, of three days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not having in all that way above two Pits of Water.</p>
               <p>The Village <hi>Tarum,</hi> which is the Chief of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villages, was much decay'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. The Inhabitants thereof are ſubject to the Prince of <hi>Lar.</hi> It hath under its Juriſdiction the Village <hi>Seid Geuder,</hi> beyond which is a large Plain, and at a ſmall diſtance runs the Brook <hi>Abſciur,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Salt Water.</hi> A little further is a Village call'd <hi>Pelengon,</hi> that is, <hi>A Panther;</hi> ſo nam'd from the great number of that ſort of Beaſts breeding thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Two Leagues from <hi>Pelengon</hi> you come to a narrow way between the Mountains, in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Der Tenghi Cebar Rud,</hi> that is, <hi>The narrow Gate of four Streams;</hi> becauſe in Rainy Weather four great Currents, which come from ſeveral Places, unite their Waters there.</p>
               <p>After three or four Leagues travelling through a pleaſant Way, you come to a Place call'd <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazirgon,</hi> that is, <hi>The Merchants Grave;</hi> perhaps ſo call'd becauſe a Merchant died and was buried there. Four Leagues further lies a ſolitary and ruin'd Place, nam'd <hi>Ser Zehi Rizevon,</hi> about which ſtands onely a few Huts, ſhaded on one ſide by a Grove of Date-trees: And four Leagues further is <hi>Taſtek,</hi> inhabited by none but the <hi>Rabdary</hi> or Watchmen to guard the Way.</p>
               <p>Two Leagues from <hi>Taſtek,</hi> along an even Way between the Mountains, lies a Place call'd <hi>Abi Dungher,</hi> the utmoſt extent of the Dukedom of <hi>Lar,</hi> and the beginning of the Country which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the King of <hi>Ormus,</hi> when he was abſolute Maſter of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Road from <hi>Schiras</hi> to <hi>Iſpahan.</hi>
                  </note>Travelling from <hi>Schiras</hi> to <hi>Hiſpahan,</hi> you paſs by theſe Places: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the Village <hi>Zargan,</hi> in which is a handſom and well-built <hi>Moſque.</hi> Four Leagues further you come to <hi>Mahin,</hi> which being an open Town, contains between five and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Houſes; but is ſo inclos'd with Gardens and Orchards of all ſorts of Fruit-trees, that it rather ſeems at a diſtance a ſhady Grove than a Town.</p>
               <p>A little forward from <hi>Mahin</hi> you come to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Village call'd <hi>Amanzada,</hi> conſiſting onely of a few Houſes, all encloſed within a Wall'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravanſera,</hi> in which ſtands alſo a rich <hi>Pagode,</hi> out of whoſe Revenue all Travellers that reſt there are maintain'd for three days.</p>
               <p>The whole way from <hi>Mahin</hi> to this <hi>Caravanſera</hi> is very craggy, and troubleſom to travel, and is border'd on the left Hand by a high Mountain, whoſe top lies crown'd with Snow till the middle of Summer.</p>
               <p>Three Leagues from <hi>Amanzada</hi> lies <hi>Ugion,</hi> a Village on a Plain; and between both, a very ſteep Mountain, whoſe Southern ſide is full of <hi>Lentisk</hi> Trees, out of which drops <hi>Maſtick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Place ſtands a <hi>Moſque</hi> to which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhew great Reverence, by reaſon of a Tomb in which lies Interr'd one of <hi>Aly</hi>'s Succeſſors; and the Villagers report, that many ſick, blind, and decrepit People have receiv'd Health, and been reſtor'd to their Sight and Limbs, by imploring the aid of the foremention'd Perſon, whom they account a Saint. The Plain on which this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage is ſituate is water'd by a ſmall River, whoſe Stream, though muddy, is yet very full of Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Four Leagues from <hi>Ugion</hi> is <hi>Acopas,</hi> a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, enclos'd with a Mud-wall, and ſurrounded with high Mountains. In the middle of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, on a Mount, ſtands a ſmall decay'd Fort, round about which, and within the Walls, are above a hundred Houſes, moſt of them Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Circaſſians.</hi> Hard by ſtands a large <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſera;</hi> and not far from it a Garden, planted with divers ſorts of Fruit-trees, and curious Walks of Cypreſs and Palm-trees, which one <hi>Alavardy Chan</hi> planted a little before his death.</p>
               <p>Four or five Leagues from <hi>Acopas</hi> lies <hi>Curcuzar,</hi> a ſmall Fortified Town, with a <hi>Caravanſera</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning. All the way between <hi>Acopas</hi> and <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuzar</hi> is low and Moraſſie; the Air alſo is unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: Wherefore the <hi>Perſians</hi> have not without great reaſon call'd this Place <hi>Curcuzar,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Infectious Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond this is the Village <hi>Dergriger,</hi> three Leagues from which ſtands a <hi>Caravanſera,</hi> and another pretty Town; next to which follows <hi>Comixan,</hi> containing about fifteen hundred Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p>A little beyond <hi>Comixan</hi> lies the Dorp <hi>Mahiar:</hi> And laſtly, between that and <hi>Hiſpahan,</hi> about a League from the latter, is a Village nam'd <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſtan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Perſia</hi> is water'd by a large River, call'd <hi>Cur,</hi> which is a corrupt Name of <hi>Cyrus. Philip of Ferara</hi> in his <hi>Geography, Olearius,</hi> and others, will have this to be the ſame River which the <hi>Latins</hi> call'd <hi>Begradas:</hi> But <hi>Della Valle</hi> contradicts this Opinion, affirming, That <hi>Bendemir</hi> is the Name of a Bridge which lies croſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, near the way coming from <hi>Iſpahan</hi> to <hi>Schiras;</hi> but its right name is <hi>Curis,</hi> as is before mention'd; for <hi>Bend-Emir</hi> ſignifies <hi>The Bridge of Emir,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> call a Bridge <hi>Bend,</hi> and <hi>Emir</hi> was the Name of the Builder.</p>
               <p>The ancient Writers make mention of two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Aſia</hi> which bear the Name of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> the one whereof having waſht <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> diſcharges its Water into the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> and, as <hi>Olearius</hi> ſays, is at this day call'd <hi>Cur</hi> or <hi>Aras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, which we now ſpeak of, glides from the North to the South through <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the Walls of the City <hi>Schiras,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Gulph. From the Banks of this River the famous <hi>Cyrus</hi> was thrown in his Infancy, and gave his Name to the Place, and not to that where he was born, which was call'd <hi>Agradat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Perſian Geographers,</hi> as <hi>Olearius, Garcias de Sylva, Figueroa,</hi> and others, judge the River <hi>Cur,</hi> or <hi>Bendemir,</hi> to be the ſame; with <hi>Araxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Araxes</hi> is the biggeſt of all thoſe Rivers which water the Provinces of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Lara;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, it is not very broad, but runs in a narrow Channel, in many Meanders, between high Mountains, being well repleniſh'd with all ſorts of Fiſh.</p>
               <p>This River takes its Original out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Jeſſel,</hi> lying between the famous Cities <hi>Suſter</hi> and <hi>Margaſcan,</hi> formerly call'd <hi>Suſa</hi> and <hi>Perſepolis;</hi> and firſt directingits Courſe Southward, bends
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63517:14"/>afterwards to the Eaſt, ſeparating the ancient Province of <hi>Suſiana</hi> from the Weſtern part of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi> and ſo enters into the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and after having receiv'd the Waters of many little Rivolets, and divided the Province of <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and the ancient <hi>Caramie Foelix,</hi> finding its Current to the Sea ſtopt by the exceeding high Mountains, it returns with great force to the North-Eaſt, being grown bigger than before, and much deeper, by the Waters which fall from the fore-mention'd Mountains; thence it again runs Southward, viſiting the ancient <hi>Gedroſie,</hi> and at laſt falls into the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, making a ſpacious Bay.</p>
               <p>Near the Ruins of <hi>Cehil Minar,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> glides the River <hi>Pelevar,</hi> which takes its Courſe towards the South, and falls into the <hi>Cur,</hi> after having firſt water'd one of the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Parts of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſia</hi> is very Mountainous in ſeveral Places; but they are not altogether ſterill: for the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Neriz</hi> have many Iron Mines; and ſome relate that many <hi>Smaragds</hi> are found in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. About ten or twelve Leagues from <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> are ſeveral high Hills, full of Palm and Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisk-Trees, where breed many Wild Hogs.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Schiras,</hi> which is common to all the other Provinces of this Kingdom, are very white, the Women generally beautiful, and the Men well-proportion'd.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a great Trade driven in <hi>Schiras,</hi> occaſion'd by the <hi>Caravans,</hi> which coming from <hi>Samarcand</hi> and <hi>Zagatay,</hi> paſs through this Place with great Quantities of Silk, Musk, Rhubarb, and <hi>Turcoiſes;</hi> all which thoſe of <hi>Chorazzan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Merchants which come from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay,</hi> or the Northern <hi>China.</hi> And by this means <hi>Schiras</hi> furniſhes other Countries with Proviſions, as Wooll, Copper, and many other things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Diſtill'd Roſe-water; for they make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort than we in <hi>Europe,</hi> by decocting the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. They alſo get abundance of Silk from the Silk-worms they breed here; and have likewiſe Rubies, <hi>Balayſes</hi> (which come from the City <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi>) and great ſtore of <hi>Lazuus</hi> Stones, and <hi>Tutty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſia</hi> or <hi>Fars</hi> is not very cold, though its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation be more Northerly than the other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for in <hi>December</hi> all the Gardens about <hi>Schiras</hi> are green, and the Trees retain their Leaves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ground being moiſten'd by ſo many Rivers, is not onely preſerv'd from all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Scorchings, but ſo cooled, and the Fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ripe ſo late, that it may be preſerv'd all the Winter, and kept very good till <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country about <hi>Schiras,</hi> and the Plains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mountains and the River <hi>Paſa,</hi> is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dry and barren.</p>
               <p>The Country about <hi>Rexel,</hi> near the Sea-coaſt, yields very excellent Wheat, and alſo good ſtore of Fruit: That Tract of Land which extends Southerly produces abundance of Dates; as alſo the Ground about the City <hi>Com:</hi> but no Vines. The Country of <hi>Tarom,</hi> with the other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Places, are all planted with Date-trees, under whoſe the Inhabitants ſow Cotton. There is alſo abundance of Sweet-briar, out of whoſe Flowers the Inhabitants diſtill a ſort of Water which they call <hi>Gulaep,</hi> that is, <hi>Roſe-water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of the gaping Ciefts of a high Mountain in the Country <hi>Stahanon,</hi> diſtils a Liquor or Juyce which the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> cauſes to be gather'd by Perſons ſworn for that purpoſe, which yearly take up thirty <hi>Meticals,</hi> or about forty or fifty Ounces of the ſaid Diſtillation, which by the <hi>Perſians</hi> is call'd <hi>Monmaky Cony,</hi> that is, <hi>Precious Water;</hi> and is kept onely for the King's Uſe: it being, as they affirm, an excellent Antidote againſt all Poyſon, and an infallible Remedy againſt inward Bruiſes, as alſo outwardly apply'd for Sinew-ſtrains, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions, and the like. The King many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows ſome of it upon thoſe Princes that are in League with him, as an extraordinary Mark of his Favor. In ſtead of this, the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe <hi>Terra Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata;</hi> the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of the Eaſtern Countries, <hi>Pazar Cony,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Jews-Gum,</hi> gather'd at <hi>Maxulpata,</hi> or <hi>Muſulipatan,</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> but is not of that Vertue and Power as this of <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About <hi>Schiras</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> find a ſort of bitter Root, by the Apothecaries call'd <hi>Coſt,</hi> from the example of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> though they generally add the Word <hi>Talk</hi> to the ſame, <hi>viz. Coſt-Talk,</hi> that is, <hi>Bitter Coſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the common <hi>Indian Coſt,</hi> which they call <hi>Coſt Xerir,</hi> that is, <hi>Sweet Coſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bitter Coſt</hi> hath a Root very hard and firm, of a yellow Colour, ſomewhat inclining to white, if it be freſh and good; but if it be digg'd out of ſeaſon, or careleſly dry'd, it becomes blue or brown: The Shell or Rind is ſtreak'd, and the Pulp white, and bitteriſh: The old Roots are very unſavory and ill-taſted. It is brought into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> either in round Pieces, or elſe in long Slices.</p>
               <p>The Country about <hi>Laſtan</hi> produces abundance of <hi>Ingo,</hi> by the Apothecaries call'd <hi>Aſſa foetida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Fars</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Schiras,</hi> they have very excellent Wine, the beſt in all <hi>Perſia,</hi> which they call <hi>Xarao</hi> or <hi>Charab;</hi> and it is ſent to all Parts of the Country, eſpecially to the Court; for the King and his Nobles drink no other: and if any Perſon of Quality entertains another, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways treats him with this Wine.</p>
               <p>This Province alſo produces Bezoar-ſtones, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> properly call <hi>Pazahar,</hi> which is a Compound Word of <hi>Pa</hi> and <hi>Zahar,</hi> the firſt ſignifying <hi>Againſt,</hi> and the other <hi>Poyſon:</hi> They are chiefly found in a County call'd <hi>Stabanon,</hi> three days Journey from <hi>Lara;</hi> where alſo grows in the Fields a Plant like Saffron, which the Goats eating, cauſes the foremention'd Stones to grow in their Stomachs, and are eſteem'd above all other Gems by the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> Nay, the Fields wherein the ſaid Goats graze are conſtantly guarded, and the collecting of the Stones look'd after by Officers appointed particularly for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a Stone by the Phyſicians call'd <hi>Lapis Judaicus,</hi> that is, <hi>The Jews Stone;</hi> and by the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians, Ager Alyud,</hi> that is, <hi>The Stone of Judas.</hi> There is likewiſe the <hi>Armenian Stone,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> and in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Tongue nam'd <hi>Ager Armeni,</hi> that is, <hi>The Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt many other Beaſts which breed in <hi>Perſia,</hi> there is one peculiar to this Province, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> call <hi>Caſtar,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards, Adives;</hi> and is perhaps the <hi>Hyena</hi> of the Ancients. They breed for the moſt part in the Hedges about <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and are, as <hi>Garcias de Sylva</hi> affirms, a kind of Dogs bred firſt in <hi>Barbary.</hi> They come in great companies out of the Hedges in the Night, to ſeek for Prey, making a hideous howling. They are naturally ſo ſubtile, that if they were not ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63517:14"/>very greedy, they could not be taken. They tear up the Graves in the Fields, and devour the Dead Bodies; and often, when hungry, they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into Houſes, where if they find any thing, they call their Companions, by making a great noiſe; whereof the Inhabitants taking notice, ſurround and catch them.</p>
               <p>This Province of <hi>Perſia</hi> comprehends the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kingdom or Dukedom of <hi>Lar,</hi> or <hi>Lara,</hi> with a Metropolis of the ſame; denomination; from whence the <hi>Laryns</hi> (a Coin ſo current in all the Eaſtern Countries) had their name, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Lara</hi> is by <hi>Figueroa</hi> accounted part of the old <hi>Carmanie,</hi> as <hi>Oëſsa</hi> (commonly call'd the Kingdom of <hi>Monbareca</hi>) the other part; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Countries of <hi>Mogoſthan.</hi> This ancient Dukedom was formerly poſſeſs'd by a peculiar Prince, who Govern'd with an Arbitrary Power, and not ſubject to the Crown of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The laſt Prince, according to <hi>Gaſpar Bernardino,</hi> was call'd <hi>Abrahi Mochom;</hi> but by <hi>Della Valle, Ibrahim Chan;</hi> by <hi>Figueroa, Hambrain Chan;</hi> and by our Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Erahim Cawn;</hi> an Atheiſtical and bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Perſon. But <hi>Alvaredy Chan, Sultan</hi> of <hi>Schiras,</hi> invading him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1602. by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Schach Abbas,</hi> ſtorm'd the City of <hi>Lar,</hi> and kill'd the King, beſides all the Nobility and Gentry, to the number of five thouſand; cauſing alſo the Caſtles to be pull'd down, and the Walls thrown to the Ground, leaving nothing ſtanding that was of any Strength or Conſequence. And in this manner the Kingdom of <hi>Lar</hi> was joyn'd to the Crown of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and added to the Dominion of <hi>Schiras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City <hi>Lar</hi> at <hi>Lara</hi> is a very ancient City, and of great note amongſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> being the Metropolis, as <hi>Figueroa</hi> ſuppoſes, of the old <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi> It is ſituate in 27 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude, at the end of a great Plain, ſo enclos'd with Mountains, that they leave onely a little Opening or Way, which leads to <hi>Schiras.</hi> When this City was firſt built, cannot certainly be reſolv'd: Some aſcribe the Age thereof to that of our firſt Forefathers; others ſay, it was founded not much above a thouſand years ago.</p>
               <p>The Walls of the Houſes are made of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry'd Bricks and Clay, and plaſter'd over with a kind of Mortar made of chopt Straw and Earth, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe in all their Buildings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Provinces of <hi>Lara, Querman,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> Moſt of them are but one Story high, having few Windows, and thoſe very ſmall, and cover d with Lattices, or ſtopt with Mats.</p>
               <p>In this City is an ancient Palace, formerly the Reſidence of the Prince, with a large Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; which had ſtood empty a conſiderable time, when the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Schiras</hi> came to <hi>Lar</hi> to take poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
               <p>Here are likewiſe two other remarkable Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The one, a Caſtle or Fort; the other, the <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Exchange. The firſt, being almoſt half a League in circumference, is built of Free-ſtone, on the Weſt ſide of the City, on a little Hill, and fortified with thirty eight ſtrong Bulwarks, which defend the City from any outward At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and alſo Commands it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Figueroa</hi> affirms, That the Caſtle covers the whole top of the Mountain, which is Oval, and fortified with a Stone Wall, and a Breaſt-work, with divers Loop-holes for ſmall Shot. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large in circumference, and hath a Well with excellent Water, above two hundred Fathom deep; for it reaches quite down to the City: yet is the Water nevertheleſs very eaſily drawn up, with a Wheel turn'd by an Ox.</p>
               <p>The other Place of note in this City, is the <hi>Bazar;</hi> that is, A Street full or Shops, like the Exchange. This <hi>Bazar</hi> was the Work of <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy Chan,</hi> the before-mention'd <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Schiras;</hi> and is without doubt one of the faireſt and beſt in all <hi>Aſia.</hi> It conſiſts of an exact Square, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd within high Walls of white Stone, each Square being 150 Paces, and in every one a large Gate, through which you enter into a fair Walk, that opens into four Rows of Shops, each twenty Foot broad, making a Croſs-way; in the middle whereof is a very high Turret, full of large Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, built on four Arches of Stone, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their beginning from thence, cover the four Walks: The Materials ſo neatly painted and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, that they out-vie Marble: The Ground is alſo very curiouſly pav'd. In four other Squares, but much leſs than the former, are four other ſmall Croſs-ways, which have alſo a Turret in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of each; from whence, as from the great one, run four other leſſer Arched Walks of fifteen or ſixteen Foot broad. Almoſt in the middle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Turret or Arch, is a Spring of Freſh Water, which is brought thither in Pipes from Places far diſtant, and convey'd from thence to all Parts of the City.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Bazar</hi> are ſold all manner of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, as well in the Shops by the Inhabitants, as by Foreign Merchants, who ſtay here all day to vend their Goods, and return to their Lodgings in the Evening, when the <hi>Bazar</hi> is lock'd up, and guarded by a Company of Soldiers appointed for that purpoſe. In ſome of theſe Shops are ſold both Green, Dry'd, and Preſerv'd Fruit; as alſo In-land Bread, call'd <hi>Hapas</hi> or <hi>Curichas:</hi> But the Country-People which bring their Commodities to ſell, have no peculiar Shops, but lay their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe on Stalls before the Shops, leaving a ſufficient ſpace between, for the People to paſs.</p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Bazar</hi> is the Mint, where they Coin the <hi>Laryns</hi> before-mention'd.</p>
               <p>There are few <hi>Moſques</hi> here; but amongſt thoſe which are, there is one built round, to repreſent <hi>Eternity,</hi> after the ſame manner with the <hi>Alcaba</hi> or Holy <hi>Moſque</hi> at <hi>Mecha,</hi> which <hi>Schach Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have brought from Heaven. On ſome Places thereof are <hi>Arabian</hi> Letters, Cyphers, and ſhort Sentences graven, after the <hi>Moſaick</hi> manner. It is a low Structure, having in ſtead of Windows onely Carv'd Balliſters. The Entrance into the ſame is through a Copper Gate, near which hangs a great Looking-glaſs. There are alſo many Lamps, ſome of which are kept continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others hang onely for Ornament. Some of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Prophets lie here interr'd; and amongſt others, one call'd <hi>Emir Ally Zedday Amir,</hi> who, if what they affirm upon Oath may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, hath been there above 1500 Years, <hi>viz.</hi> 600 Years before <hi>Mahomet;</hi> yet nevertheleſs, they ſtick not to affirm, that he was a good <hi>Muſelman</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Lar</hi> is the uſual meeting-place of the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> or <hi>Cafilas</hi> which travel from <hi>Perſia, Querman,</hi> and other Places, to the Iſle of <hi>Ormus;</hi> and come from thence, and <hi>Arabia,</hi> to theſe Provinces: Wherefore this City is much frequented by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63517:15"/>as well <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> as <hi>Benjans</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> and to that purpoſe are built many <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravanſeras,</hi> for the accommodation of ſtrange Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that come thither with their Commodities.</p>
               <p>This City hath been much ruin'd by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, one of which, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1400. threw down above a hundred Houſes; and another, <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. above three hundred, or, as <hi>Texeira</hi> affirms, five hundred; at which time alſo many Water-Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, and the greateſt part of the City Walls were ſpoil'd. The ancient Caſtle formerly built by a <hi>Georgian</hi> call'd <hi>Melek,</hi> on a Stone Rock on the Eaſt ſide of the City, was alſo caſt down.</p>
               <p>A League from <hi>Lar</hi> is a <hi>Caravanſera</hi> call'd <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Place in this Dukedom of <hi>Lar,</hi> at the entrance of the Country which belong'd to the King of <hi>Ormus,</hi> when he was abſolute Maſter of his whole Kingdom on the Main Continent of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> is <hi>Abi Dunger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Climate, we cannot ſay there is any great Cold at <hi>Lar,</hi> the Air being ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that in <hi>March</hi> you can ſcarce get into the City, for the abundance of Flies and Gnats, which in great Swarms fill the Air. But in <hi>June</hi> there blows ſuch a hot and dry Wind, that on all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over which it paſſes, it leaves Impreſſions as of Fire; and withal ſcorches the Faces, Hands, and Legs of Strangers, to their great trouble and pain; call'd therefore by the <hi>Perſians Bad Semum,</hi> that is, <hi>An infectious and burning Wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Country of <hi>Lar</hi> is very deſtitute of Water; for there are neither Brooks, Springs, nor Wells; onely in ſeveral Places on the Road are plac'd Troughs, which catch the Rain-water, which ſerves for the accommodation and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Travellers. Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> ſays, this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very unwholeſom, and occaſions many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, as well in the Inhabitants as Strangers; <hi>viz.</hi> Rheums, Sore Throats, and Worms in the Legs, which cauſes Itching and Lameneſs, and is not to be cur'd without taking out the Worm; and this muſt alſo be done with great care; for if the Worm chance to break, it cauſes Putrefaction and Numbneſs in the Part affected, which is only to be remedied by continual cutting and ſlaſhing of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>There is nothing worthy of praiſe in all the Country about <hi>Lar,</hi> but the Charitable Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divers of the Inhabitants, who, beſides the Ceſterns which the ancient Kings of <hi>Lara</hi> and their Governors made, for the Publick good and Refreſhment of the Inhabitants and Travellers which come daily hither, in their laſt Wills ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point certain Perſons to build with their Eſtates Ceſterns, <hi>Caravanſeras,</hi> and Alms-houſes; ſome great, and others little, according to their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Zeal in their Religion: and by this means there are ſo many Ceſterns, that the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Plain is full of them; and the Water therein is very clear and cool in Summer, notwithſtanding the great Heat.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Lar</hi> and the Parts adjacent are ſeveral ſorts of Fruit-trees, as Oranges, Lemmons, and the beſt Dates in all <hi>Perſia.</hi> Moſt of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants live on Dates, partly by making them their Food, and partly by ſelling and bartering them for other Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Between <hi>Lar</hi> and <hi>Gamron</hi> grows abundance of <hi>Aſſa Foetida,</hi> by the <hi>Maleyans</hi> and <hi>Javanners</hi> call'd <hi>Hin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were <hi>Arabians,</hi> of which there are yet many living.</p>

The Caſtle, which is alſo the Treaſury, is built pretty ſtrong, and Plaiſter'd over with Lime. On the South-Weſt ſide of the Town runs an indifferent large Stream, call'd <hi>Senderuth,</hi> which ſpringing out of the Mountain <hi>Demawend,</hi> divides it ſelf into two ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, call'd <hi>Haws</hi> and <hi>Burke.</hi> Beſides which, there are divers Wells and Springs up and down, ſo that the whole City is very well ſerv'd with Water.

               <p>Amongſt ſeveral others, there is one Village, call'd <hi>Schechmuras,</hi> where the Front of the Houſes are built of Stone, and the Back-parts cut into the Mountain, but cover'd over with Canes, Straw, and the like.</p>
               <p>On the top of the Mountain riſes a clear and ſweet Spring, which paſſing between the Rocks, breeds abundance of Craw-Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Not far from hence are other Mountains of two Leagues long, and behind them a Village call'd <hi>Diſle,</hi> in which the <hi>Indians</hi> that come to Trade at <hi>Schamachie</hi> built a <hi>Caravanſera,</hi> Anno 1639.</p>

The Houſes are built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der high Trees, and ſo ſhaded with the Boughs, that they are ſcarce to be ſeen, inſomuch that one may doubt whether <hi>Eskerf</hi> be a City erected in a Wood, or a Grove inhabited like a City.

The Streets are broad, extending far in a ſtraight Line; before the Houſes are Channels, to receive and carry away the Water, which elſe, by reaſon of their even lying, would make them very dirty: In one of which ſtands a Royal Building, the chiefeſt Gate whereof opens into a long and ſpacious Street. Upon one ſide of this Palace may be ſeen a ſquare Court, croſſing which you come to a Garden Door, into which none but Grandees are permitted to enter. This Garden lies behind the Palace at the foot of a Hill, beſet with Trees, and adorn'd with Banquetting-houſes built on the ſame by King <hi>Abbas.</hi> The Garden being one large Square, hath in the middle a <hi>Dewanchane,</hi> or Terrace-Walk; twice as long as broad, open towards the North, with an Aſcent of two or three Steps, but behind, and on the other ſide, clos'd up with a Wall, wherein are divers large Windows.

There are alſo many little Huts of Boughs and Date-tree Leaves, which are much us'd here; and becauſe there are no hard Stones hereabouts, and the Timber extraordinary ſcarce; many ſtately Houſes have been pull'd down on the Iſle, and the Materials thereof car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away to build Houſes on the Main.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide of the Countrey ſtands a Fort, built after the ancient manner with Towers.

               <p>By reaſon of the vaſt Extent of <hi>Perſia, viz.</hi> from the twenty fifth Degree of the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> to the thirty ſeventh Degree Northward, and likewiſe for the rough rocky Mountains of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which run through the middle of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſpread out with ſeveral Arms, the Air is not every where alike temper'd, but different in many Provinces. Such as dwell Southward from the Mountains feel the Heat exceedingly in the Summer, but thoſe to the Northward have the Seaſons more temperate; wherefore the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Kings us'd formerly at Set-times in the Year, for their Pleaſure and Health ſake, to remove their Courts to ſuch Provinces, where they judg'd the Weather would beſt agree with them: for in the Summer they kept their Courts at <hi>Ecbatane,</hi> now call'd <hi>Thus,</hi> where becauſe of the Mountains in the South-Weſt, it is very cool, and in the Winter at <hi>Suſa,</hi> now <hi>Suſiſtan;</hi> which City lies next to the Northern Mountains, on which the Sun-beams reflecting, make the ſame a warm and delightful Place, as appears by the Name, for <hi>Suſa</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue ſignifies a <hi>Lilly.</hi> In <hi>September</hi> and <hi>March</hi> they remov'd to <hi>Perſepolis</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> to this day make uſe of this convenience of the Air, for <hi>Schach Abbas</hi> in the Winter reſided in the Province of <hi>Mazanderan</hi> at <hi>Ferabath; Schach Sefi</hi> (according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings) often going on Progreſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kept his Court in <hi>Tabris,</hi> otherwhile in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debil</hi> or <hi>Caſbin:</hi> But the preſent Seat of the Kings being in <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> is no inconvenient Place either in Winter or Summer, becauſe it is ſituate on a Plain three Leagues from the Mountains, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys commonly a very temperate Air.</p>
               <p>All Strangers in their travelling through <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> are ſenſible of this alteration of the Air in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, not without great prejudice to their Health, being forc'd by reaſon of the exceſſive Heat to travel in the Night, and reſt in the Day, eſpecially between the Mountains, where the Paſſage goes Southward. But in all parts of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> it is very cold in Winter, and ſometimes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Eaſtward with a Northerly Wind it is ſo exceeding cold, that the Travellers lighting from their Horſes in the Morning, are ſo benumm'd that they can hardly ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Della Valle</hi> ſays, that the Heat in <hi>Perſia</hi> is not very great, yet the Beams of the Sun in the Plains are much hotter than in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Inhabitants in the Summer go Cloth'd in a thin Sute of Callico, in which they walk and do all their Buſineſs. Neither is the Cold troubleſom to them, partly becauſe it is not very great, notwithſtanding it Snows much there, and partly becauſe it laſts but <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February.</hi>

               <p>The Soil in <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſpecially ſo call'd, is very dry and ſtonie, and therefore requires much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring to fatten it, by which, and the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd in Pipes, the Fields are fertiliz'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſeveral ſorts of Corn and Fruit in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>

The third ſort, call'd <hi>Lohk,</hi> though they are alſo ſenſible and hot for Procreation, yet they are not ſo good as the <hi>Bughurs;</hi> neither do they foam at the Mouth as the <hi>Ner,</hi> but in ſtead

The <hi>Sophy</hi> and his <hi>Chans</hi> or Vice-Roys, keep ſeveral Teams of theſe leſſer Camels, which are employ'd either to fetch in Ambaſſadors, at which time they are caparison'd with Crimſon Silks, and Bells, and other Ornaments about their Necks and before their Breaſts, and have rich Embroider'd Saddles; or elſe they are us'd as we our Poſt-Horſes, and carry Goods from Place to Place like Pack-Horſes; and moreover they uſe them in their Wars, for if a Party chance to be defeated, they with more ſpeed convey away their Baggage; but ſome of them Trot ſo hard, and as it were, Jumping, that no Man would be able to endure it long. One Man is able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage ſeven or more, for he makes them faſt one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind another, and either rides upon, or walks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foremoſt. It is very convenient travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Perſia</hi> by the help of theſe Camels, for by them Merchants have their Goods carry'd at rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Rates; and if any Perſons are not minded to travel alone,<note place="margin">The Camels Diet.</note> they go for their better ſecurity with the <hi>Cavila</hi> or <hi>Caravans.</hi> A Camel is for the moſt part fed with Nettles, Thiſtles, and other Weeds. On the Thiſtles oftentimes breed poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Snails, in the Countrey Language call'd <hi>Mohere,</hi> by which if a Camel be ſtung in the Noſe, he dies ſoon after; therefore when the <hi>Perſians</hi> are angry with them, they wiſh the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> to ſting them in the Noſe. They alſo mix Chaff and Barley together, and make Dough thereof in form like a long Loaf about three Pound weight, which they give them to eat: Sometimes they mix the Seed of the Cotton-Tree, which is about the bigneſs of a Peaſe, with it, which makes it very ſweet, and with which a Camel being well fed, will travel two days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Drinking, which is a great Providence in Nature, becauſe in the Wilderneſſes and Sandy Deſarts, through which they often travel, there is no Water to be found. The Camels of <hi>Perſia</hi> are (according to <hi>Della Valle</hi>) fed with Barley Meal mix'd with Straw, and made into Balls: for if they eat Graſs, it debilitates them both for Travel and Service: They are very willing to take up their Loads, for ſtriking them onely on the Knees with a Switch, they immediately kneel-down, and lying with their Bellies on the Ground, ſuffer themſelves to be loaden. They go much faſter,<note place="margin">They are pleas'd with Muſick.</note> and carry their Burdens with delight (as Mr. <hi>Sandis</hi> affirms) when their Drivers Whiſtle or Sing to them, or make them any other Muſick; wherefore the Owners of them tie two Bells above the Knee of one of their fore Legs, and a Collar of ſmall ones about their Necks. Mr. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> relates, That the <hi>Arabians</hi> for the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Reaſon, never travel without a Drum and Drummer through the Deſarts. The ſame is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd by <hi>Leo Africanus,</hi> who adds, That when Travellers have tir'd their Camels, they need not beat them (which they regard not) to make them go forward, but onely Sing or Whiſtle a pleaſant Tune, which ſo animates and refreſhes them, that they go faſter than a Man is able to run, to the end of their Journey.</p>
               <p>Theſe Beaſts have a ſtrong Memory,<note place="margin">Are revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> are vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative, and do not eaſily forget an Injury done to them, wherefore the <hi>Perſians</hi> commonly ſay, That a revengeful Man hath a Camels Spleen. But that there ſhould be an Antipathy betwixt a Camel and a Horſe (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes) is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, becauſe it is very common in <hi>Perſia,</hi> in one <hi>Caravan</hi> to have Camels, Horſes, and Aſſes, which are often put in one Stable together, without offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the leaſt hurt to one another.</p>
               <p>The ſhe Camels carry their Young twelve Moneths, and do not Generate backward, as ſome will have it, though it be true, that when they ſtand in the Stable they Urine backwards, which perhaps hath been the occaſion of that miſtake; for they Couple like other Beaſts, onely the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male falls on her Belly.</p>
               <p>Now in regard a Camel is a Beaſt that may be kept at a ſmall charge, they are ſeldom kill'd in <hi>Perſia,</hi> except they are ſtung by a <hi>Mohere,</hi> or fall down tir'd on the Road (as it often happens in deep Ways) and then they kill and eat them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Very good Breeds of Horſes.</note>
                  <hi>Perſia</hi> is alſo ſtor'd with plenty of good Horſes, moſt of them having very handſom Heads, Ears, Creſt and Legs. In ancient time the Province of <hi>Media</hi> was famous for breeding of excellent Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were call'd <hi>Niſean</hi> Horſes, from a City of that Name; and (as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us) the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> us'd no other. But though at this day the <hi>Median</hi> Horſes, eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Erſcheck</hi> near <hi>Ardebil,</hi> are good, yet the <hi>Arabian</hi> far exceed them, and are now us'd by the Kings, becauſe they have very handſom Heads, Creſt, Breaſt, and Feet, are long Winded, and have all the good Qualities elſe that Nature can beſtow on a Horſe. Next theſe the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſes are in great eſteem, eſpecially thoſe that are bred in <hi>Turcomania,</hi> of which there are many in <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King hath ſeveral peculiar Places for the breeding of Horſes, eſpecially at <hi>Erſcheck, Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan, Carabach,</hi> and <hi>Mocan,</hi> where the beſt Paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is. They generally uſe them to Ride on, but in <hi>Muſcur</hi> they alſo draw in Carts, for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons with four Wheels they uſe none. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are great lovers of Horſes and Riding, and their chiefeſt Force conſiſts in their Cavalry, therefore they breed them with great care. But in ſtead of Straw they Litter them with their own Dung, dry'd in the Sun, and ſtrew'd a Foot thick under them, on which the Horſes lie as ſoft as on Cotton; and if any of it become wet, it is taken from the reſt and dry'd: They cover them alſo with a Hair Cloth Lin'd with Wool.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> have been Maſters of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Horſes ſince the Death of the Sultan <hi>Boriſir,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> caus'd to be put to death, after his coming from <hi>Carmania</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> with many beautiful Horſes, to the number of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, of all which he made himſelf Maſter, and from them the <hi>Perſians</hi> have had ſuch excellent Breeds, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are inferior to them.</p>
               <p>They bring up and diet their Horſes for the Race; and thoſe that are ſwift-footed they ſtyle <hi>Badpay,</hi> that is, <hi>Wind-footed;</hi> they alſo colour the Tails, Mayns, and Bellies of their white and dapple Horſes, red or yellow. They are very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their Furniture, and therefore Perſons of Quality Embroider their Sadles, Bridles, and Cloths with Gold and Silver, which is an ancient Pride of the <hi>Perſians</hi> ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Xerxes.</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:63517:51"/>Theſe Horſes, though employ'd night and day in a Battel, can endure thirty hours without Meat.</p>
               <p>There are alſo a ſort of Stags, by the <hi>Turks</hi> call'd <hi>Tzeirra,</hi> and by the <hi>Perſians Ahu,</hi> of a ſad colour, have great Horns, and being very ſwift-footed, are to be ſeen in no place but the Province of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and by <hi>Schamachie, Carabach,</hi> and <hi>Mearaga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants likewiſe keep many Mules, eſpecially to Ride on, being us'd by great Lords, nay, by the Kings themſelves to travel on, they are valu'd at as dear a Rate as the Horſes, and thoſe that are any thing handſom are ſold for a hundred Crowns. Moreover ſome have reported, that there are wild Mules found in ſeveral places in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> but being very rare, they are onely ſent as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the King and <hi>Chans;</hi> and as <hi>Aſia</hi> breeds more Aſſes than any other Place in the World, ſo <hi>Perſia</hi> exceeds any of the Eaſtern Countreys.</p>

Moreover, the great number of the <hi>Quizilbaſcies</hi> is a ſufficient teſtimony of the Tribes: Likewiſe thoſe of one Tribe have no Relation to thoſe of another, but onely bear the ſame Name. Add hereunto the great difference in the Qualities of the People in one Tribe, for ſome of them are <hi>Chans, Sultans,</hi> and <hi>Beigs,</hi> which may ſtand in competition with our Lords; others, nay the greateſt number, are poor People, in ſo mean Condition, that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſerve for Grooms and Servants; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they bear the ſame Title with the <hi>Sultan</hi> or <hi>Chan</hi> of the ſame Tribe.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. King <hi>Abbas</hi> falling into a great Fit of Sickneſs at <hi>Ferhabad,</hi> occaſion'd by a Potation of too much Wine, he cauſed an Edict to be publiſh'd with the ſound of Trumpet; wherein all the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in <hi>Iſpahan</hi> were forbid to drink Wine, yet the <hi>Armenians, Georgians, Franks,</hi> and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may Carouſe as much Wine as they pleaſe, provided they neither ſell nor give any to the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> upon pain of death.</p>
               <p>This Law was with great ſtrictneſs obſerv'd publickly by all the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> not onely in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan,</hi> but through all the Kings Dominions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that ſome for violation thereof were put to death.

               <p>
                  <hi>Della Valle,</hi> who at that time was at <hi>Iſpahan</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> tells us, that he had more Viſitants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Grandees, than uſual, becauſe the King had not onely given him a Toleration for drinking Wine himſelf, but to diſtribute to thoſe <hi>Mahumetans</hi> that Viſited and made Addreſſes to him, provided he ſuffer'd them not to uſe any ſuch exceſs; as to be ſeen inebriated in the Street repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the King himſelf drank Wine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, yet very little, that ſo he might not be an ill Example to his Subjects; to which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Diſtemper forc'd him, according to the directions of his Phyſicians, who preſcrib'd him to drink onely what might be conducible to his better Health.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants in the Province of <hi>Perſia,</hi> of which <hi>Sciras</hi> is the Metropolis, drink Wine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; and the rather, becauſe being far from the Court they are become as it were Lawleſs: But in the other Provinces the Laws are ſo obſerv'd, that it is dangerous to mention Wine.</p>
               <p>In all the Country about <hi>Ardebil</hi> are no Vines, partly by reaſon of the Cold, and partly becauſe the <hi>Sceichavends,</hi> that is, <hi>Scheicks Succeſſors,</hi> would not plant any there, becauſe it was a ſacred Place, where <hi>Scheich Sofi</hi> ſet up a New Sect, which next to <hi>Mahomets</hi> at <hi>Mecha,</hi> and that of <hi>Aly</hi> and <hi>Huſſein,</hi> is moſt follow'd.</p>

               <p>Before and after Meals, the <hi>Perſians</hi> both in Winter and Summer, have warm Water to waſh their hands, which they wipe with their Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.

But there are many excellent Copies of the ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> Poets, as well in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> as <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Language; for as they eſteem both Tongues alike, ſo they read the <hi>Turks</hi> Poetry with as much pleaſure as the <hi>Perſian.</hi> The beſt Poets amongſt them are diſtinguiſh'd by theſe Names, <hi>viz, Saadi, Haſis, Firdauſi, Fuſſuli, Chagani, Eheli, Schems, Nawai, Schahidi, Deheki, Neſſimi.</hi> Their Verſes cloſe almoſt after the <hi>German</hi> manner,<note place="margin">Their method in Verſifying.</note> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to like ſounding words at the end of each Verſe, but mind not the number of Feet. Some Verſes are onely a few words, which being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd into ſeveral places, make the Verſes divers; and to this purpoſe they often uſe ſuch words as have a double ſignification; ſome end with the ending word of the former Line, as thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Tzire, tzire, tzirag Janitze,</l>
                  <l>Adamira demag Janitze?</l>
                  <l>Tzire, tzire, tzirag Oſteri bud?</l>
                  <l>Adamira demag Cheri bud.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Some begin with the ending word, and end with the beginning word of the former Line, as in the following Verſes:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Kalem be deſt Debira beh haſar derem,</l>
                  <l>Derem be deſt neajed Meker nauk kalem.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Here the ſecond Verſe begins with the word wherewith the firſt ended, and the laſt ends with the ſame with which the firſt begins; ſo that we may conclude, though they have a high conceit of themſelves, yer we can diſcover nothing by this, but that they are very mean Poets.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Boterus</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Sofi</hi> troubles himſelf but little with the Mogul; becauſe between both Realms (as betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) are very narrow Paſſages, and the Situation of the Borders very Rocky and troubleſome; by which means the conveying of Proviſions that way, and the keeping of Forces there is very inconvenient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Forces in pay.</note>It is ſaid, that King <hi>Abbas Anno</hi> 1620. kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly one hundred thouſand Horſe in Pay, of which about thirty thouſand guarded the Cities on the Frontiers, from whence they never ſtirr'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Engagement, onely when it was judg'd fit, then they are remov'd from one Quarter to another. Beſides this numerous Army which receives Pay, are alſo many Voluntiers, perſons of Quality, of which, ſome keep fifty, nay a hundred Men in their Service, which receive annual Revenues, and carrying Arms, are reckon'd amongſt the <hi>Militia,</hi> as likewiſe Sutlers, Merchants, Handicrafts, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel-drivers and Commiſſaries, which all bear Arms; beſides their Wives which are no leſs in number than the Men, according to the antient Cuſtom of the People of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> affirms) carry their Families with them to the Wars; ſo that the King's Army conſiſting as well of other men as Soldiers, amounts to between two and three hundred thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>The City <hi>Iſpahan</hi> with the Villages belonging to the ſame, is able in a ſhort time to raiſe ſixty thouſand Men beſides the ſtanding Forces.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers marching in the Army obſerve a good Order, and make little noiſe,<note place="margin">Their order in marching.</note> uſing neither Drums, Trumpets, nor any other Muſical or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Inſtruments; none daring to take any thing but what they pay for where ever they are Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, by which means the Countrey-People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great benefits by the Army's marching through their Towns or Villages, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants or Handicrafts without any ſuſpition of being wrong'd of their Goods, let the Soldiers have ſuch things as they want, Sutlers travel with Fruit, Sweet-meats, and Snow in the midſt of Summer, to ſuch places where they expect the Army to come. For their better accommodation the Inhabitants of thoſe Countreys in hopes of gain ſtore up great quantities of all manner of Proviſion againſt the time that they expect the Army to come thither, where they diſpoſe of them at their own Rates, which is not ordinary.

                  <hi>Della Valle</hi> tells us that the greateſt differences between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and other <hi>Mahumetans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from this occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> When <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his laſt Expedition with his Army between <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina</hi> and <hi>Mecha,</hi> riding upon a Camel before all his Followers, taking <hi>Aaly</hi> by the Hand, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to get up behind him; ſaying to his People, <hi>Thoſe that have had me for their</hi> Veli, <hi>ſhall alſo have</hi> Aaly <hi>my adopted Son.</hi> The word <hi>Veli</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> hath two ſignifications, and may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either for the Chief or Head of a Church or for a Friend or Favorite <hi>Aaly</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors believ'd the firſt ſignification, and ever ſince maintain'd that <hi>Mahomet</hi> by this Saying choſe <hi>Aaly</hi> to ſucceed him, as well in the Government of Spiritual as Temporal Affairs, and that by the Power of this Declaration, <hi>Aaly</hi> and his Succeſſors ought for ever to be the Governors of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Race; but after <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Death a Will was brought forth, wherein <hi>Abubeker Mahomet</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law (for <hi>Mahomets</hi> laſt Wife <hi>Aiſne,</hi> was <hi>Abubeker</hi>'s Daughter) was nam'd Heir and <hi>Califa,</hi> or ſpiritual and worldly Succeſſor; which Will was made by the Practice of <hi>Aiſne,</hi> or as the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſay, forg'd by her; but the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> ſay that <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf chang'd his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe <hi>Aaly</hi> was too yong and unexperienc'd; whereas <hi>Abubeker</hi> was aged, and a man of prudence and good conduct; ſo that they conclude that <hi>Mahomet</hi> by the foremention'd diſcourſe never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make <hi>Aaly</hi> his Heir or Succeſſor, but onely to make known to him that they ſhould ſhew the like reſpect arid honor to <hi>Aaly,</hi> as they had done to him; And in truth they do little leſs, for they reverence <hi>Aaly</hi> as a great Saint, and account him the chief Head of their Religion; nay, for the true <hi>Calif</hi> or Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> though not the firſt immediately after him, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> relate, but the fourth in order, <hi>viz.</hi> after <hi>Abubeker, Omar</hi> and <hi>Odſman.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now in regard the <hi>Perſians</hi> promote <hi>Aaly</hi> to that Dignity, and aſcribe divine Vertues and Powers to him, they judg'd it fit that his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors (which were undoubtedly inſpir'd with the like Graces) ought to have more Honor ſhew'd them than other Common-people, and therefore they viſit their Tombs, and pray at them with great devotion, and make rich Offerings to them.

                  <hi>Olearius</hi> tells us, that Writers call the laſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Kings <hi>Sophy,</hi> becauſe the Promoter of their Sect was call'd <hi>Schach Sefi,</hi> from whom it is become a Title of Honor, as <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain, Moſt Chriſtian</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Iſmael</hi> alſo caus'd himſelf to be nam'd <hi>Schach Sade,</hi> that is, <hi>The Son of Schach,</hi> as a token of his Extract from <hi>Schach Sefi,</hi> who was ſo highly eſteem'd amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Some ſay that this Name <hi>Sophy</hi> ſignifies a Man, which renouncing the World, endeavors onely to ſerve God; ſo that <hi>Xeque Iſmael</hi> bore the Title of <hi>Sophy,</hi> becauſe he appear'd to be the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of his Sect. And ſometime before him, <hi>Halilah</hi> being advanc'd to great Dignity, was for the ſame reaſon call'd <hi>Sophy.</hi> But ſince <hi>Schach Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> none of his Succeſſors have us'd that Title; and though there are a great number of <hi>Sophies</hi> through all <hi>Perſia,</hi> yet we muſt know they are all Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
               <p>The right Name which the <hi>Perſians</hi> give to their King, is <hi>Schach</hi> or <hi>Sa,</hi> after the <hi>Italian</hi> pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſignifies <hi>King;</hi> or <hi>Patxa,</hi> which others write <hi>Padiſcha,</hi> that is, <hi>The ſupream Schach,</hi> or <hi>King of Kings:</hi> They alſo call him <hi>Sahib,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Governor.</hi> Some alſo affirm, that the Kings are likewiſe nam'd <hi>Choda</hi> or <hi>Chodohon,</hi> which in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue ſignifies <hi>God;</hi> but that is onely a miſtake, for <hi>Choda</hi> or <hi>Chodabende</hi> as the Sir-name of <hi>Schach-Abbas</hi>'s Father; the natural ſignification of the word is one that is oblig'd to God.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court are many which bear the Title of <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Chan</hi> and <hi>Sultan</hi> have the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of <hi>King,</hi> the one in the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, which proceeds from hence, becauſe the chief Princes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to make themſelves the more eminent, will have Subjects that are ſtyl'd Kings, though in truth they are but Vice-Roys.</p>

The Ice which they uſe is made of the cleareſt Water after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Not far from the City in a great Plain, a Bank is rais'd or caſt up, directly from Eaſt to Weſt, which being about a hundred and fifty Foot long, and very thick, is ſo high, that it ſhadows the Plain from the Sun-beams when the Sun is at the heighth: At the end of this Bank are two Arms, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from the South to the North, are full as high as the main Bank, and about twenty four Foot long, and keep off the Morning and Evening Sun; ſo that this Plain lies ſhaded all the day long: In this ſhady place is a Moat of about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty Foot deep, extending from the one Arm of the Bank to the other: In the midſt of Winter when it Freezes hardeſt, they Plough this Plain, which lies open to the Northern Winds, full of ſmall Furrows about three or four Fingers deep, and ſo letting in the Water, overflow it,

But <hi>Della Valle</hi> tells us, that the King gives the Dignity of <hi>Chan</hi> to one of his Subjects, not onely for his Life, but alſo permits his Children to ſucceed him after his Death, and that there are Families found that have enjoy'd this Title above two hundred years.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the King hath made any one a <hi>Chan,</hi> he immediately gives him Lands and Men to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Grandeur, which he enjoys as long as he lives; but if at any time he chance to be ſuſpected by the King, he is immediately turn'd out of his Employment, and all his Goods ſeiz'd.</p>
               <p>Each Province hath a <hi>Chan</hi> and a <hi>Calenter,</hi> who reſides in the Metropolis thereof. The <hi>Chan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's Vice-Roy, Executes the Law, doth Juſtice to all, and paſſes Sentence of Death on Criminals, without any ſpecial Order from the Court.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt <hi>Chan</hi> is he who Governs <hi>Sciras,</hi> the Metropolis of the Province of <hi>Perſia,</hi> properly ſo call'd, who is able to bring an Army of thirty thouſand Men into the Field, the Countrey which he Commands being ſaid to be bigger than <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Calenter</hi> is as a Collector or Treaſurer of the Province, gathering all the Revenues, and giving an Account thereof either to the King or <hi>Chans.</hi>

               <p>They never gave the Crown to a one-ey'd, ſquint-ey'd, or deformed Perſon, as appears by the ſquinting Son of <hi>Cahade</hi> or <hi>Robad,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he was a valiant Man, yet for the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in his Sight was diſinherited.

               </p>
               <p>They were honor'd like Gods, for thoſe that approach'd them, bow'd not onely their Heads and Bodies, but fell flat on their Faces, with their Hands upon their Backs; in which poſture they lay as long as they ſuppos'd him to be in ſight; which was alſo perform'd by Strangers, who were not permitted to ſee the King, unleſs they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to worſhip him after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, for otherwiſe they were forc'd to let him know their Buſineſs by Proxy, or elſe in Writing; which when he perus'd, he return'd his Anſwer without being ſeen.</p>

                  <hi>Mengrelia</hi> is alſo divided by ſeveral Rivers, which, like moſt of the great Rivers of <hi>Aſia,</hi> have their head Springs in Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue into the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> The firſt of them, which riſes Eaſtward, is the Stream by the Ancients call'd <hi>Faſis,</hi> and now <hi>Faſo</hi> or <hi>Fas,</hi> by the <hi>Scythians</hi> (according to <hi>Thevet</hi>) <hi>Debbaſſetcha,</hi> and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>Rione,</hi> which (as <hi>Procopius</hi> affirms) falls with ſuch force and violence into the Sea, that it makes the Water freſh for ſome Miles. But this is contradicted by <hi>Agricola:</hi> And <hi>Archangel Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti,</hi> who hath ſeen the ſame ſeveral times, ſays this River at firſt runs very ſwift from its Fountain Head, but coming amongſt the Plains, it is ſo ſlow, that 'tis ſcarce diſcern'd to move, and yet certain it is, that its Water doth not commix with the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Stream <hi>Faſo</hi> diſembogues it ſelf into the Sea through two Mouths, between which it makes an Iſland, by the Ancients call'd <hi>Ea,</hi> wherein the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Year 1578. built a Fort, which was ſince pull'd down. At the ſame time the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor <hi>Amurat</hi> took the City <hi>Teflis</hi> from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſuppoſing it would have been a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Harbor for him to keep his Galleys in, that from thence they might go with the more eaſe to conquer <hi>Perſia</hi> (which then he deſign'd) and make himſelf Maſter of the City <hi>Colatis,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and Key into the Countrey on that ſide; to which purpoſe his Galleys alſo went a great way up the Stream: But the <hi>Georgians</hi> having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd themſelves at the Entrance of the River, where it is narroweſt, Entertain'd them ſo rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they forc'd them to return. Above the Iſland the Stream is above half a Mile broad, where its Banks are alſo overgrown with Trees, and frequented by Fiſhermen, who come thither to catch Sturgeon. Farther up into the River lie many ſmall Iſlands, of which ſeveral are Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: To each Houſe which is built on the ſame belongs a ſmall Barque, made of a hollow Tree, in which the Women Row from place to place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arrianus,</hi> who by the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand went to diſcover this River, ſaith in one of his Letters, that on the left ſide of the Mouth of the River he ſaw the Image of the Goddeſs <hi>Rhea</hi> in a Temple, which in the time of the Emperor Emperor <hi>Zenon</hi> was Dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Recas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next River is <hi>Sceni-Skari,</hi> that is, <hi>The Horſe-River,</hi> by reaſon of its ſwiftneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arrianus,</hi> and all thoſe Geographers that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, place other Rivers between the <hi>Faſo</hi> and <hi>Sceni,</hi> but by miſtake: for it is certain, that the <hi>Sceni</hi> is the firſt Stream which falls into the <hi>Faſo,</hi> but afterwards receives the <hi>Abaſſin</hi> and <hi>Tachut;</hi> the <hi>Abaſſin</hi> is the <hi>Glaucus</hi> of <hi>Strabo,</hi> and the <hi>Tachut</hi> the <hi>Sigam</hi> of <hi>Arrian,</hi> though he places it towards <hi>Copo.</hi>

               <p>Next follows the River <hi>Enguria,</hi> anciently call'd <hi>Aſteltes,</hi> which <hi>Arrian</hi> places near the <hi>Cia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus:</hi> It falls with extraordinary ſwiftneſs from the Mountains inhabited by the <hi>Sovanies,</hi> and ſwelling with the melted Snow that likewiſe glides from them, to that heighth, that it cannot be croſs'd without a Barque.</p>
               <p>The next in order to the <hi>Enguria,</hi> is the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let <hi>Heti,</hi> which is not found in the Maps by reaſon of its ſmalneſs, but is very eminent for a ſtrange ſort of Fiſh which is taken therein: It diſcharges its Water into the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> at a place call'd <hi>Gah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another River nam'd <hi>d'Ochums</hi> glides through a Tract of Land call'd <hi>Tarſcen,</hi> from which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Name <hi>Tarſura</hi> had its original, and by which it is mention'd in the Maps.</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Echalis;</hi> and after that the Stream <hi>Moquis,</hi> which borrows its Denomination from the City and Biſhoprick of <hi>Moquis,</hi> through which it paſſes.</p>
               <p>The laſt is the Stream call'd <hi>Coddors,</hi> anciently <hi>Corax.</hi> This divides <hi>Mengrelia</hi> from the <hi>Abaſcians,</hi> as the <hi>Faſis</hi> from <hi>Guriel</hi> and <hi>Georgia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many places of <hi>Mengrelia</hi> are great Lakes, eſpecially on the Plains where the Ground ſounds hollow when any one Rides over it, which is no ſmall teſtimony of the affinity between the <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Caſpian Seas;</hi> to which may be added, that in theſe two Seas one ſort of Fiſhes are found: for there is abundance of Sturgeon in the <hi>Black</hi> as well as in the <hi>Caſpian Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Several ſorts of Sturgeon.</note>At the Mouth of the <hi>Paſo</hi> and <hi>Enguria,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants catch abundance of Sturgeon from <hi>April</hi> till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> of which they have three ſorts, one of which call'd <hi>Zuthi,</hi> being of a far better taſte than the reſt, is carry'd to the Court, and dreſ'd for the King's Table. The ſecond ſort call'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giachia,</hi> differs not much from the firſt, onely it is the bigger, and the Fleſh not altogether ſo good. The third ſort nam'd <hi>Poronci</hi> is yet larger, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like a Buffalo, but its Fleſh is not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the other. The Inhabitants cut theſe Fiſh into pieces of two Hands breadth, which the Salting, dry in the Sun, and afterwards uſe as Rarity. Of the Rocs they make <hi>Caveare,</hi> which putting into ſmall Veſſels, they Salt, ſetting it in the Sun till it condenſe into a Body or thick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The leaſt Sturgeon call'd <hi>Zuthi,</hi> hath a bigger Roe than the reſt, neither is any part of thrown away but the flat Bones which ſtick in the top of the Skin, beſides which it hath no other except a Griſtle about a Finger thick, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from the Head to the Tail.</p>
               <p>The Fiſhermen have certain ſigns whereby to know when it is beſt Fiſhing, as by the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Water, which from the melted Snow falling into the ſame, is greedily coveted by the Sturgeon.</p>
               <p>They alſo take here another ſort of Fiſh call'd <hi>Suia,</hi> and by the <hi>Turks, Calcan Baluch,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Pilcher, being exactly of that form, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with little Scales, but hath two Eyes on one ſide, the one grey and the other white.</p>
               <p>This Fiſhing begins in <hi>December,</hi> and continues till <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome Seaſons there are abundance of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in this Sea, and the greater the number of them is, the more Sturgeons they are ſure to catch that year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. the Sea had thrown ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Herrings on the Shore between <hi>Trebizonde</hi> and the Countrey of the <hi>Abcaſſians,</hi> that they lay above half a yard thick upon one another, like a Bank.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Oyſters, which the Fiſhermen throw into the Sea again when they catch them in their Nets; yet ſome of them have courſe Pearls in them, ſuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes he ſaw in the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> of <hi>Thracia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rivers are full of <hi>Voorn,</hi> of which there are two ſorts, the one call'd <hi>Calmakka,</hi> is very ſmall, and the other <hi>Aragoli,</hi> which is bigger; the firſt ſort are catch'd in the North Sea, and the other onely in the Rivers; in which, and on whoſe Banks are likewiſe Beavers, contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s opinion, who affirms, that no four-footed Beaſts can live in the Sea.</p>

               <p>Eagles are likewiſe very common here, and are taken by the Inhabitants onely for their Wings, the Feathers whereof they fallen to their long Arrows.</p>
               <p>Every Man in <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> though never ſo poor,<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> keeps a Horſe, for it coſts them nothing. Some Noblemen have two hundred, and the Prince himſelf two thouſand, which are every year Train'd in the Field; they never ſhoe them but in the time of War.</p>
               <p>Sheep do not thrive well in this Countrey, by reaſon of the moiſtneſs thereof, yet their Wooll is exceeding fine.</p>
               <p>In the Mountains breeds alſo a certain Beaſt, which is half like a Goat, and half like a Stag, and of the ſame bigneſs, with brown Hair; its Horns are like a Goats, bending backwards. The Fleſh of this Beaſt is very delicate, and accounted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of a Stag. They alſo breed in <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are likewiſe all ſorts of wild Beaſts which are in <hi>Europe,</hi> and many white Bears, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Mountain <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which ſeem to be peculiar to that place, becauſe there are none in any of the neighboring parts.</p>
               <p>On the Borders of the <hi>Abcaſſians</hi> are ſaid to breed wild Buffalo's and Wolves, which do great miſchief to the grazing Cattel, which get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Body, and defend themſelves with their Heels.</p>
               <p>There are no Foxes, but a Beaſt call'd <hi>Tourra,</hi> which reſembles them, but are ſomewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and hath more ſhaggy Hair; they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Herds, and make a great noiſe in the Night; they are very miſchievous, beſides their Prey carrying away Shoes, Boots, or other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, from ſuch People as lodge in the Fields.</p>
               <p>This Countrey hath great variety of Fruits.</p>
               <p>On the Banks of the River <hi>Faſis</hi> grows ſweet Wood.</p>

               <p>They have alſo another ſort of white and hard Honey, like Sugar: Its colour perhaps caus'd <hi>Pliny</hi> to affirm, that there bred white Bees about the <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> or <hi>Black Sea;</hi> which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants contradict, affirming, that the Bees which make this Honey are like others, and that the whiteneſs thereof proceeds from the abundance of Dew which falls in this Countrey, out of which the Bees extract the Honey. This white Honey is much coveted in this Countrey, but not carry'd to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> like the other, becauſe gather'd in Winter, when they drive no Trade, the Sea being lock'd up. The Inhabitants oftentimes put their Honey into the Rind or Shells of bitter <hi>Citrullen,</hi> from whence <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, that the Honey which is gather'd on the Mountains in the time when the Lawrel bloſſoms, makes all thoſe vomit that eat of the ſame, and therefore is taken by them for a Vomit in Phyſick.</p>
               <p>It is certainly believ'd, that there is plenty of Gold and Silver on that part of Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> which verges this Countrey, but the Inhabitants conceal it, becauſe they would not intice the <hi>Turks</hi> thither.</p>
               <p>They get abundance of Gold near the City <hi>Arudan,</hi> in the Province formerly ſubject to the Prince <hi>Artabegi.</hi> There is alſo Antimony.</p>
               <p>Some have reported, that the Prince of <hi>Imereti</hi> keeps divers Men at work in the Mines in his Dominions, but ſo privately, that he caus'd one of his Subjects reſident in <hi>Dadian,</hi> at his Return from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither he had carry'd a Proof of the Gold and Silver which was digg'd out of thoſe Mines, to have his Hands and Feet cut off, as a Puniſhment for his holding Correſpondence with the <hi>Turks.</hi>

               <p>They ſay there is alſo a Gold-Mine in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cavis.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Several ſorts of <hi>Mengre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi>
                  </note>The <hi>Mengrelians</hi> are of ſeveral Degrees and Qualities; the firſt call'd <hi>Ginaſca,</hi> are eminent Lords; the ſecond <hi>Ginandi,</hi> are Nobles; the third <hi>Sakkurs,</hi> are the Rich; and the fourth nam'd <hi>Moinalli,</hi> are the Commonalty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ginaſca</hi> onely attend upon the Prince, and are themſelves ſerv'd by the <hi>Ginandi;</hi> and theſe again are waited upon by the <hi>Sakkurs</hi> and <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None can attain to a higher degree of Honor than the Family in which they were born: for he that is born amongſt the Commonalty can never riſe higher, though he be the richeſt Man in the whole Countrey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moinalli,</hi> or common ſort of People, do all ſervile Offices for the Nobility, <hi>viz.</hi> chop their Wood, follow them on foot, carry their Baggage when they travel, and the like, The richeſt of them muſt give a Cow, a Basket full of Corn, Bread, Wine, and Fruits, for an acknowledgment of their Vaſſalage; nay further, they muſt Lodge all Strangers which the Nobility ſend to them, and alſo Entertain their Landlords whenſoe're they are minded to viſit them.</p>
               <p>When a Family of the Peaſants is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, their Lords inherit their Goods; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when all are dead except one, they ſell him to the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that their greateſt Riches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in having many Slaves.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Mengrelians</hi> ſpend their time in Tilling and Manuring their Lands, and the rather, becauſe they have no manner of Corn brought them from any other Parts. Their greateſt Labor after they have Sow'd their Corn, is Weeding; to which purpoſe the Fields are always full of Workmen, who are Entertain'd by their Maſter with great Feaſting: for after their Day-labor is finiſh'd, they go Singing to his Houſe, where is provided for them great ſtore of Meat, as alſo Wine; which that they may not want at that time, they generally in Harveſt-time Conſecrate ſome Tuns of their beſt to <hi>St. George,</hi> with promiſe not to taſte it till the Feaſt-day of <hi>St. Peter</hi> and <hi>St. Paul,</hi> which is the time before mention'd; but when that is come, they bring a Prieſt in all his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits into their Wine-Cellar, where reciting ſome Prayers, he broaches the Cask, and ſends a Pot full of the Wine to <hi>St. George</hi>'s Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their firſt Money.</note>Before Prince <hi>Dadian</hi> invited the <hi>Armenians</hi> to Trade in his Countrey, there was no Money, but they barter'd Commodities for Commodities; but this Prince, to his great benefit and advantage, caus'd a Coin to be made with <hi>Arabian</hi> Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks, like that which paſſes in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and is call'd <hi>Abaſſi;</hi> notwithſtanding the Inhabitants rather affect Pieces of Eight, and other ſtrange Coin.</p>
               <p>They Trade with the <hi>Turks</hi> in ſeveral places, and at ſeveral Fairs, the biggeſt whereof is kept in <hi>September,</hi> juſt before the Church of <hi>Cipourias</hi> and the other in <hi>St. George</hi>'s Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Trade with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </note>The <hi>Turks</hi> about this time coming from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> bring Carpets, Stools, Bowes, Arrows, Cloth, Iron, Copper, Wooll, Cotton-Clothes, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which they carry back Honey, Flax, Yarn, Swords, Beaver Skins, Slaves, and Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, by which they gain great Sums of Money: for 'tis evident, that for every four hundred Crowns-worth of Salt which they bring into this Countrey, they get above five thouſand of Wood.</p>
               <p>The Lords ſell their Subjects for Slaves to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Men their Wives, whereof the chief Lord of the Soil always receives a third part, the Parents of the Women another part, and the Husband the reſt.</p>
               <p>A Nobleman once having a mind to a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe, gave his own Mother in Exchange for him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mengrelians,</hi> who account it a happineſs to change their Habitations when they pleaſe,<note place="margin">Houſes.</note> like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> never beſtow any great coſt on their Buildings, notwithſtanding they have all manner of Materials to Build withal, but eſpecially good white Stone. Common Houſes are not divided into ſeveral Apartments, but conſiſt in one large Room, in which the Maſter, Miſtreſs, Servants, and all, both Men and Women, dwell together. They always keep a great Fire in the middle of the Hall in the Winter. The Walls of their Houſes are of Wood, and the Roofs cover'd with Straw, which makes them very ſubject to take fire. Their Halls are generally full of Smoak, and dark, having no other Light than what comes in at the Door. They leave theſe Houſes with great willingneſs, whenſoe're they are minded to remove.</p>
               <p>In the Winter they commonly goe into the Woods, where being ſecur'd from the ſharp Winds, they ſpend their time in Hunting. In the Summer they dwell on the Hills, and in the Spring and Harveſt they chuſe ſuch places for their abode, where they may have the benefit
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63517:76"/>both of warm Weather and cold but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dwell a great diſtance from the Sea, partly for the bad Aire, and partly to be ſecure from the Invaſion of Pyrates.</p>
               <p>Before Noblemens Houſes are generally large Squares, ſurrounded with Moats and Gardens, planted full of Trees; round about the Squares are built divers Lodges at a certain diſtance one from the other to prevent Fire; that which ſtands next to the Entrance is call'd <hi>Ochus,</hi> where they receive all Strangers, the reſt ſerving either for Cellars, Kitchins, and Wardrobes, which being ſtronger than the reſt, are built in the form of a Tower. In the middle of all theſe Lodges or little Houſes, which ſtand round about the Garden incloſing the Square, there commonly ſtands a Chappel, wherein they all go to Maſs.</p>
               <p>The common People are generally very poor,<note place="margin">Habits.</note> wearing onely a woollen Lappet about their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, from their middle down to their Knees. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality Clothe themſelves in foreign Stuffs, but wear a Girdle cover'd with a Plate, at which they hang their Sword, and all other things which are requiſite to be us'd on a Journey, <hi>viz.</hi> a Knife, a Hone, a Leather of three Inches broad, and half a Yard long, a Tinder-box, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bag full of Salt, and another full of Pepper and other Spices, and a Wax Candle. The Shirts which they wear are wrought with Gold at the bottom and about their Necks, and hang out over their Knees; their upper Garment is alſo ſhorter than their Shirts. In cold Weather they wear Furr'd Coats. Their Bonnets or Caps are ſharp on the top. They account the <hi>European</hi> Hats an eaſie and commodious Wear; but ſince none in that Countrey could learn to make them of Wooll, ſome have made them of Straw, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them with Sear-cloth, as alſo with Woollen Cloth and other Stuffs; which Hats they put on over their Bonnets or Caps in rainy Weather, or elſe againſt the heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>By reaſon of the poorneſs of the Countrey they very ſeldom make any Feaſts or great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; yet they live plentifully, and are very free of what they have. Amongſt other Diſhes they boyl pounded Barley to a Dough, which they ſet on a woodden Peel before their Gueſts, who eat the ſame inſtead of Bread. They bring this firſt to the Table, and the Perſon appointed for that purpoſe runs with it from one Man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; which done, he gives another ſort of finer Dough to the moſt noble Perſon on a Chip, the Cook ſerving up the other Diſhes in the mean time. They never ſet Chairs nor Stools for their Gueſts, but they ſtand round about the Table, which ſerves them alſo both for Diſhes and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. When they have any Spoon-meat they make a Hole in their Dough, into which they put their Broths: In ſtead of a Table-cloth they ſpread a Carpet of Leather, which is thirty Foot long, and ſo greaſie, that the ſight thereof is enough to turn a ſqueamiſh Stomach.</p>
               <p>As theſe People ſpend their whole Life-time in the Field, ſo their greateſt delight is Hunting, in which every one recreating himſelf, hath made a Proverb amongſt them, <hi>That a Mans Happineſs in this World conſiſts in a Horſe, a good Dog, and a Hawk.</hi> The Prince appoints ſet-times for Hunting, to which he invites all his Nobles. The time which Prince <hi>Dadian</hi> generally choſe to Hunt in, was when the Deer went a Rutting, at which time going into the Thickets with his Attendants, he ambuſcado'd himſelf, and ſhot the Stags as they paſs'd by.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other Games and Paſtimes,<note place="margin">Recreations.</note> they uſe to play with a Ball on Horſeback after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Gameſters ſtanding in a row, the Ball is thrown up into the Air by him that ſtands at the upper end, whilſt others following him, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor with a Racket of four or five Foot long, to ſtrike the Ball forward; he that catches it laſt, throws it to the end of the Line, and begins the Game again.</p>
               <p>All trouble and charges of celebrating their Nuptials, conſiſt in Preſents,<note place="margin">Nuptials.</note> which the Men are bound to give to the Brides Parents.</p>
               <p>Some years ſince the Prince of <hi>Odiſci</hi> Courted the Princeſs <hi>Caſciach Mepe,</hi> Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> who demanded of him a hundred Slaves loaden with Cloth and Carpets, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Head of Cows and Oxen, and a hundred Horſes.</p>
               <p>When a young Man or Suitor goes to viſit his Miſtreſs, he is oblig'd to carry ſome Wine and an Ox with him, with which her Parents Feaſt and make Merry. On the Wedding Day, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Prieſt be not preſent to Betroth them, they go into their Cellar, a place no leſs reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd amongſt theſe People than the Temples; the Prieſt holding two Garlands, and firſt ſetting one on the Bridegrooms Head, ſays, <hi>N.N. Be Crown'd the Servant of God for the Maid N. of God;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he ſets on the Brides, ſaying, <hi>The Maid of God N. N. be Crown'd for the Servant of God N.</hi> which done he takes a Glaſs of Wine, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the ſame to the Bridegroom, whil'ſt the Clerk holds the Garlands, and after they have drank, cuts the Thred which held their Clothes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ends the Ceremony.</p>
               <p>When any of their Parents or Friends die,<note place="margin">Funerals.</note> all thoſe that dwell in the Houſe lament with many diſtracted ſigns of ſorrow; the neareſt Relations pull off their Clothes, and go naked from their Middle upwards; then they divide themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Parties, who make Reſponces one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, often repeating the word <hi>Ohi.</hi> This time of Mourning ſometimes laſts three years. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop alſo celebrates Maſs for the Deceaſed, to his great benefit, getting many times five hundred Crowns. After Maſs is finiſh'd they all give the Biſhop a Treat, and new Habits to all the Prieſts which attended the Funeral: for the greateſt Coſts and Charges which they beſtow on any thing, is on theſe Solemnities. They alſo invite the Prince or Lord of the Countrey to mourn over the Deceaſed, whoſe Dogs they place under one Pavilion, his Horſes under another, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a third his Sword, as alſo other things which he us'd when he was living. The Prince being naked from his Middle upwards, and bare-footed, falls on his Knees under each Pavilion, where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf ſeveral blows on the Face, he cries, prays, and ſighs: after which riſing, he goes to the Houſe of the Perſon which invited him, where a Feaſt is prepar'd for him, and alſo a Preſent.</p>

Their Shirts being made of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, are Dy'd red. The Women wear black Hoods, Edg'd in ſtead of Lace with fine Cotton Cloth, which they tie under the Chin. The Widows wear behind on their Heads two great blown-up Bladders, cover'd with white Cotton, on each ſide one, which at a diſtance ſhews like three Heads. In the Summer they go onely in their Shifts, which are either colour'd red, green, yellow, or blew, and are open down to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; they likewiſe wear Amber Beads, painted Shells, Stones, Tin and Copper Plates, about their Necks, which hang down below their Breaſts. The Women are very familiar, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Strangers, the Parents permitting their Daughters to be handled by any Perſon; and if Strangers be Lodg'd in their Houſes, their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Mornings viſit them, arid entertain them with amorous Diſcourſes; Virgins alſo go naked in the prefence of all Perſons into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to Bathe themſelves.</p>

            <p>It is accounted ill breeding amongſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to have any knowledge in Arithmetick, or to drive any Trade, becauſe a Nobleman (as they ſay) ſhould never trouble himſelf with anything but to preſerve and defend his People, Hunt, and be a good Warriour.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their manner of living.</note>They live for the moſt part upon Sturgeon and other Fiſh, though ſometimes they eat both tame and wild beaſts: Their Bread is principally of Barley, and the uſual Drink of the common People is Water; but they make a Liquor of a ſort of Grain which they call <hi>Boeza,</hi> or (as <hi>John de Luca</hi> ſaith) they mix their Water with Honey and Barley, which letting ſtand ten days to ſoak, they afterwards boyl, whereby it becomes pleaſant to the taſte, and as ſtrong as Wine. In ſtead of Cups or Glaſſes, the Vulgar uſe the Horns of wild Buffalo's, or other Beaſts; but the Nobles drink out of Golden Cups, worth from three to five hundred Ducats; ſome alſo are of Silver, out of which they drink with great deliberation and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and commonly in the Name of God, and their Saints or deceaſed Friends.</p>
            <p>They commonly ſleep with a Coat of Mayl under their Heads in ſtead of a Pillow, and with their Arms by them. As ſoon as they riſe they put on the foremention'd Coat of Mayl. The Men and Women lie together, but Head to Feet, yet on one Bed, which is commonly made of Leather, and fill'd with Ruſhes and Roſe-Leaves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de Luca</hi> affirms, That the Houſes are made of two rows of Poles ſtuck in the Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which they lay plaſh'd Boughs, which they cover with Mortar and Straw; nor are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Palaces built of better Materials, though bigger.</p>

            <p>The continual Alarms in which their Enemies keep them,<note place="margin">Their Arms.</note> hath made them the beſt Horſemen in all theſe Parts. They uſe Arrows, which they ſhoot forward and backward, and wear a Sword by their Sides, and a Helmet on their Heads, which covers their Faces; they alſo uſe Lances and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velins, all which they handle with extraordinary dexterity.</p>
            <p>They never make any difficulty to rob one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,<note place="margin">Thievery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd.</note> which makes Stealing common here, for they never puniſh thoſe which are taken in the Fact; may, ancient People, and Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity never proffer any Drink at Meals to young Folks, if they have not committed ſome notable Robbery.</p>
            <p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ganges</hi> at laſt diſcharges its Water through two noted Mouths into the Bay of <hi>Bengala.</hi> Theſe Mouths <hi>Ptolomy</hi> places in the eighteenth and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Degree of Northern Latitude; but <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi> and <hi>Linſchot</hi> ſet them in twenty two or twenty two Degrees and a half.</p>

               <p>In the middle of the <hi>Ganges</hi> lie many great and ſmall Iſles, which are very fruitful, and all of them overgrown with wild Fruit-trees; but moſt of them at this day lie waſte, by reaſon of the <hi>French</hi> Pyrates from <hi>Racau;</hi> yet they have ſtore of wild Swine, and divers ſorts of Fowls on the ſame, as alſo Tygers, which ſwim from one Iſland to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore it is very dangerous to Land on any of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ganges</hi> is ſuppos'd to abound with Gold and Pearls,<note place="margin">Its Riches.</note> and from its bottom are fetch'd all manner of Precious Stones, on ſome of which are perfectly repreſented the ſhapes of Beaſts, Plants, and other things.</p>
               <p>There is another <hi>Ganges,</hi> being onely two Streams joyning their Waters, which riſe firſt Eaſtward of <hi>Gavel,</hi> near the Mountain <hi>Gate,</hi> in 18 or 19 Degrees of Northern Latitude.

But this River at laſt diſcharges its Waters into one of the Mouths of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> between <hi>Angely</hi> and <hi>Picholda,</hi> in about 20 Degrees of Northern Latitude. The Inhabitants alſo hold this Water in great veneration, by which means it is very advantageous to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Lords of the Countrey through which it runs, becauſe they permit no Perſon to waſh his Face in the ſame without paying them a certain Sum of Money.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Bark</hi> riſes from another Spring on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Mount Gate,</hi> and empties it ſelf through the Gulf or Bay of <hi>Bombain,</hi> ſeparating the Kingdom of <hi>Zuratte</hi> or <hi>Cambaya,</hi> from that of <hi>Decan.</hi>

Some ſay this Beaſt is about the bigneſs of an Aſs; others, that it is no bigger than a Greyhound; but <hi>Nearchus</hi> ſwells it to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Horſe, affirming to have ſeen the Skin of one above five Foot long; it much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a Cat, having a thick Head, ſpotted Skin, glittering Eyes, ſharp Teeth, Claws with Talons, and long Hair upon the Lips, which is ſo poiſonous, that if either a Man, or the Beaſt it ſelf ſhould ſwallow one of them, it would certainly kill him; and the Inhabitants have obſerv'd, that it never goes to drink in any River, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with its Mouth before the Stream, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt it, that ſo the Water infected by its poyſonous Hair may not occaſion its own death; and for the ſame reaſon it never drinks out of Lakes, Pools, or any ſtanding Waters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Perſons are forbidden by the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> to keep any of the Briſtles of a dead Tyger, but on pain of death muſt ſend them all to his Court, where by the King's Phyſician moſt poiſonous Pills are made thereof, which are given to thoſe whom the King condemns to die at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Tygre exceeds all Beaſts in ravening, for he is ſaid to be the moſt voracious and fierceſt Creature in <hi>Bengala,</hi> and that he will follow a Ship from which he receives the leaſt injury, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty Leagues along the Shore, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inhabitants are greatly afraid of him, and call him by ſeveral Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith the Tyger is a Beaſt of wonderful ſwiftneſs; which <hi>Bontius</hi> contradicts, affirming that he is very flow, and therefore lurks, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther watches for Man-kind, who are not ſo ſwift as Stags, wild Swine, and other Beaſts, which may eaſily eſcape from him by flight; wherefore he never catches any Beaſt, except it be by ſurprize, lying ſculking in a Hedge or Thicket, from whence he leaps ſuddenly upon them; and if he chance to miſs his prey, then he returns growling back, and runs into the Wood, to ſee what he can find there; he generally ſtrikes his Tallons into the Necks of thoſe Beaſts he ſeizes, and beats the ſtrongeſt down with one ſtroke, and having firſt ſuck'd out the Blood, drags the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part into the Wood to ſatisfie his Hunger with the Fleſh by Meals. He keeps generally in the Woods, water'd by Rivers, that when other Beaſts come to drink, he may ſurpriſe and prey upon them.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe Jackalls, in the <hi>Greek</hi> call'd <hi>Hyena,</hi> Camelions, and Lizzards, beſides vaſt numbers of Ravens, which flying into the Houſes, if the Windows be open, carry away the Meat from the Table.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Vedam</hi> is the Book of their Law.</note>How and from whence this <hi>Brahman</hi> had his original, ſome of his Sect relate out of their <hi>Vedam</hi> after this manner: Before the World was created, <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> that is, <hi>God,</hi> had ſome inclination to have a new place to recreate and delight himſelf in; are and that upon the Leaf of a Tree he ſwam on the Water (for according to their opinion there was nothing but God and Water before the Creation) like a little Child, with his great Toe in his Mouth, in the form of a Circle, in teſtimony that he is without beginning or end; and that God caus'd a Flower (in the Countrey Language call'd <hi>Temara,</hi> and by us a Water-Llliy) to grow out of his Navel, and not long after out of that this <hi>Bramma</hi> ſprang. So ſoon as he had receiv'd Life, he ſtood with great admiration, and conſider'd from whence lie was deriv'd, which becauſe he could not poſſible find out, God declar'd it to him;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63517:88"/>whereupon he ſhew'd great ſigns of thankfulneſs and obedience; wherewith <hi>Weſtnow</hi> was ſo well pleas'd, that he gave <hi>Bramma</hi> power to create the World; who thereupon created the ſame, and gave Life to all things in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barthruerri,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Writer, in his Book of the Way to Heaven, confirms this, and ſays, <hi>One of great prudence and underſtanding created this World;</hi> and more plainly in another place, <hi>Why hath</hi> Bramma <hi>made the Mountain Merouwa?</hi> and again in another, <hi>Bramma hath made nothing in the World that is conſtant;</hi> by which it appears, that this is really theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Bramma</hi> was the firſt Man (as they ſay) that by the power which God gave him, created the World, with all things therein. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs few amongſt them poſitively aſcrib'd the Creation of the World to one Man, but either to God himſelf or his Son; whence we may ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Brahmans</hi> judge their foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Chief to be the Head of the Angels, or the Son of God. Theſe further affirm, that this <hi>Bramma</hi> had anciently five Heads but from the power which had been given him growing more ambitious, he attempted to defile <hi>Eſwara, Wiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now</hi>'s Conſort, which when he heard, he was ſo enraged, that he caus'd her to bring forth the Daemon <hi>Beirewa,</hi> the chief of the Devils, who with his Claws ſcratch'd off the middlemoſt Head of <hi>Bramma,</hi> as a puniſhment for his bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; ſo that he kept onely four, Heads, with which he is repreſented in their <hi>Pagode:</hi> Not long after which <hi>Bramma</hi> made many Verſes in praiſe of <hi>Eſwara,</hi> who was ſo delighted therewith, that ſhe promis'd to let him live in great Honor and Repute with his four Heads, and put the fifth on her own.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Bramma,</hi> as the <hi>Brahmans</hi> affirm, ſhall in the other World ſerve in a lower Degree; and that <hi>Annemonta,</hi> a faithful Servant to <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> ſhall enjoy his Place, all which will be inflicted on him as a puniſhment for his ambition.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Brahmans</hi> do not onely aſcribe the Creation of the World to this <hi>Bramma,</hi> but alſo the Government thereof; God (as they ſay) not once taking cogniſance of it; for they alledge, that as a King will not take the trouble upon him to Govern his Realm himſelf, but appoint Vice-Roys or Lieutenants for that purpoſe; ſo likewiſe God doth not concern himſelf with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this World, but gave the Charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>Bramma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Brathrouherri</hi> in the foremention'd Book, aſcribes the limitation of time which a Man is to live here on Earth to <hi>Bramma,</hi> ſaying. <hi>The longeſt time which</hi> Bramma <hi>hath granted Men to live, is a hundred years;</hi> and, <hi>All things which happen to Mankind on Earth, is by the appointment of</hi> Bramma; which in his Book of good Converſation he thus expreſſes, <hi>According as</hi> Bramma <hi>deſigns, ſo it ſhall be: for it is with a Man as with the Bird</hi> Tzataca, <hi>who whether it Rains much or little, he gets not above one drop thereof:</hi> His meaning is, That though a Man ſtrive never ſo much to raiſe his Fortune, it will be in vain: for whatever <hi>Bramma</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for him, he ſhall attain to, and no more. The Bird <hi>Tzataca,</hi> as the <hi>Brammans</hi> relate, drinks not of the Water which falls on the Earth, but in rainy Weather holds open his Bill to receive the Drops, ſo that whether it Rains much or little it avails not, the Bird not being able to take above a Drop at once.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author affirms in another place, that whatever <hi>Bramma</hi> hath decreed for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that will happen to him, and if any one be poor, it is by his appointment: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he hath appointed the Winds to feed the Serpents, and the Graſs for Beaſts;</hi> whereby it appears, that this <hi>Bramma</hi> is the principal, who hath ſome others under him, to whom he commits the care of ſome peculiar Places; but theſe are not accounted Gods, but onely <hi>Geweta's,</hi> or Angels. The moſt eminent of them is a <hi>Dewendre,</hi> who bears great ſway, and is chief over all the Heads of the eight Worlds: to ſeven whereof (they ſay) thoſe that have liv'd well here, go after their Deceaſe, and are all commanded by <hi>Dewendre,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Indre,</hi> as the ſupream Governor, beſides whom every Place hath a peculiar Tutelary Angel, who Commands one of the eight Worlds, which are plac'd above the Earth. Next follow the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd eight Worlds, lying between ours and <hi>Bramma-lokon,</hi> that is, <hi>The Reſidence of Bramma,</hi> the one in the North, the other in the South; the <hi>Brahmans</hi> call them as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt <hi>Indre-Lokon,</hi> where <hi>Dewendre</hi> or <hi>Indre</hi> hath his Reſidence; the ſecond, <hi>Achmi-Lokon;</hi> the third, <hi>Jamma-Lokon,</hi> which is Hell, wherein the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are puniſh'd; the fourth, <hi>Niauti-Lokon;</hi> the fifth, <hi>Warronna-Lokon;</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Cubera-Lokon;</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Wajouvia;</hi> and the eighth, <hi>Iſangja-Lokon:</hi> But theſe Worlds are not ſuch as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, onely places of happineſs like the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields.</p>
               <p>Beſides the care which theſe Governors have of their peculiar Places, they have other Concerns to look after, <hi>viz. Achmi</hi> hath the Charge over the Fire; <hi>Warrouna</hi> commands the Waters; <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jouvia,</hi> the Wind; <hi>Cubera,</hi> Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some account this <hi>Bramma</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Brahmans</hi> have ſome Books, which they firmly believe to be <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>'s own Works, which agrees with what <hi>Jarchas</hi> (according to <hi>Philoſtratus</hi>) told <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus, viz.</hi> That the <hi>Indians</hi> believ'd that which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught them concerning the Soul, and inſtructed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> therein. But <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> who writ the Life of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> makes mention in no place, that ever he was in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> or that he had any acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>antance with the <hi>Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> therefore it is to be ſuppos'd, that if <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> hath taught the <hi>Indians</hi> any thing of his Doctrine, he did it not himſelf, but by his Books, that perhaps were brought into theſe Countreys.</p>

               <p>They make Promiſes to <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for the onely God, to whom they owe Reverence and Obedience; neither do they think it ſufficient to make the foremention'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but they muſt always lead a pious and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life.</p>
               <p>They are under one ſupream Head, who dwells up in the Countrey near the City <hi>Pallacatta,</hi> in a Place call'd <hi>Combeconne:</hi> He wears not the Cord call'd <hi>Tſandhan</hi> about his Neck, as the other <hi>Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> neither hath he a Wife, but upon his entring into that Office he forſakes all worldly things, and commonly walks with a Cane in his Hand.</p>

They alſo burn another Mark in their Fleſh under their Armpits, which ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſufficient, thinking it needleſs to mark all their Limbs every day. This Sect think it enough when they have once with an upright Heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd their God to be his Servants, and believe, that though they live wickedly all their days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God will be merciful to them for that Promiſe ſake; that <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> will never forſake thoſe he once hath receiv'd into his favor, alledging, that a Father will not kill his Child, though it offend, that a Man cannot live without ſin, and therefore it is impoſſible that <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> ſhould caſt off thoſe whom once he lov'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ramanouja's Wiſtnowa's</hi> muſt go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, with ſhort Hair, except one Lock on the top of their Heads, which in a Knot hangs down their Neck.

               <p>The <hi>Ramanouja's</hi> eſteem their Sect to be better than that of the <hi>Tadwadiſtes,</hi> becauſe they are no Traders, nor frequent Houſes of publick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Sect of the <hi>Brahmans</hi> is call'd <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> or <hi>Ardhiha;</hi> the Followers thereof believe one <hi>Eſwara</hi> to be the ſupream God, making all other Deities inferior to him, nay, <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> himſelf. They make two or three Stroaks with the Aſhes of burn'd Cow-dung on their Foreheads. Some alſo wear a certain Stone call'd <hi>Lingama</hi> about their Necks, others in the Hair of their Heads, in teſtimony that they put their whole confidence in <hi>Eſwara,</hi> and acknowledge no other God but him. Their Children alſo wear this Stone cover'd with Wax at a String ty'd about their Arms, when they come to be eight or ten years of age.</p>
               <p>The third Sect is call'd <hi>Smarta,</hi> whoſe Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was <hi>Sancra Atsjaria;</hi> the Followers of whom account <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> and <hi>Eſwara</hi> to be one and the ſame, though they worſhip them in two ſeveral Shapes. They wear no outward Marks of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Amongſt the common People this Sect is not much eſteem'd, and therefore hath not very many Followers, becauſe their Opinion is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the Vulgars apprehenſion, as to the Deity of the two foremention'd Gods.</p>
               <p>The fourth Sect is call'd <hi>Scharwaka;</hi> the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers whereof, after the opinion of the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> believe no Life after this; and whatever others alledge to demonſtrate it, they deny, and will not be convinc'd without a peculiar Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>The fifth Sect is call'd <hi>Paſenda,</hi> the Followers whereof affirm, that the Doctrine taught amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> is irrational and ſenceleſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they regard it not, but onely mind their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and let all things run at random, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo with the <hi>Scharwaka's,</hi> that the Soul of a Man dies with his Body: <hi>For how</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is it poſſible, that the Body of a Man, being burnt to Aſhes, ſhould ever come to life again?</hi> But this Argument they maintain not againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Belief of the Reſurrection of the Dead (of which they have no knowledge,) but contradict the <hi>Heathens</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein, who ſet down a certain time, after the expiration of which all things ſhall be as they are now.<note place="margin">Annus Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus.</note> This Opinion was held by <hi>Plato</hi> and others, who make the time to be thirty ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſenda's</hi> are by the <hi>Brahmans</hi> eſteem'd worſe than thoſe of the fourth Sect, not onely for this their Opinion, but alſo becauſe like Beaſts they make no diſtinction between Father and Mother, Brother and Siſter. They eat with all Men, and ſleep by any Women, alledging, that in the Perſon of another Woman they lie with their own Wives, and for a good Name amongſt Men they regard it not; yet they are afraid to diſpute their Opinion with the other Sects, as fearing they ſhould ſuffer Death, for the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provok'd with indignation againſt their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abominable manner of living, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall upon, and kill them, as hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the ruine and deſtruction of many of theſe Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Sect call'd <hi>Tſchectea,</hi> neither Believe in <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> nor <hi>Eſwara,</hi> but acknowledge one <hi>Tſchecti</hi> for the ſupream God, from whom they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>Wiſtnow, Eſwara,</hi> and <hi>Bramma</hi> to have had their original, and alſo their power; and likewiſe that the World and all things in the ſame proceeded and had their Being from him.</p>
               <p>Theſe three laſt Sects being by the <hi>Brahmans</hi> accounted ſuperſtitious, have but few Followers of their wicked Opinions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Brahmans</hi> who by their retir'd way of living are ſeparated from the others, are call'd <hi>Jaques.</hi> All other People that live ſo retiredly, are either the <hi>Wanapraſta's,</hi> or <hi>Sanjaſies,</hi> or <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutes.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Wanapraſta's</hi> go with their Wives and Children into the Wood, where they live on Roots and Fruits, without doing any kind of Labor.</p>
               <p>Some are of ſo ſcrupulous a Conſcience, that they will not pluck the leaſt Root out of the Ground, fearing to ſin, and be the occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing a tranſmigrated Soul, which perhaps might be in the ſame.</p>
               <p>This kind of living in the Woods is amongſt them accounted a great piece of Religion, and the Maintainers thereof look'd upon as a very holy People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sanjaſies</hi> are a People that pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe

They go Cloth'd in Linnen, colour'd with red Earth, and carry a long Cane in their Hands; they may not ſo much as touch Gold or Silver, much leſs be Poſſeſſors of any Money. They judge it unholy to ſtay above one Night in a place, and therefore are continually travelling from one place to another. They are alſo oblig'd to conquer five Enemies, <hi>viz. Cama,</hi> that is Deſire; <hi>Croota,</hi> Anger; <hi>Lopa,</hi> Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Madda,</hi> Pride, and affection for tranſitory things; and laſtly <hi>Mattzara, Concupiſcence.</hi> In this Conqueſt they are to perſevere all the days of their Lives, ſtudying ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that lead this kind of Life, and are of the Family of the <hi>Brahmans,</hi> are call'd <hi>Sanjaſies</hi> for their excellency; but <hi>Permaanſa</hi> if of the <hi>Tettrean</hi> or <hi>Weinsjan</hi> Tribe, and <hi>Jogies</hi> of the <hi>Soudrean;</hi> whlch laſt take more freedom in their manner of living than the true <hi>Sanjaſies.</hi>

Wherefore if any of theſe <hi>Giogi,</hi> after long Faſting and Praying, can attain to the preſence of one of the ſaid Women, and by that means have future things reveal'd to them, they are for ever after highly eſteem'd amongſt their Sect; but much more if he can attain to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of being her Brother, or any other ſtep of Relation to her; but moſt of all, if he can attain to be her Husband: for then he is cry'd up as a Saint, and ſaid to have gotten more than humane Nature.</p>

They live poorly upon Alms, remain ſingle, and drink warm Water, becauſe they believe the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a Soul, and that they ſhould kill that Soul which God hath created, if they ſhould drink it cold. For the ſame reaſon they conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry little Brooms, or rather Mops, in their Hands, made of Cotton Thrums, with which, as they walk, they ſweep the Ground, ſo to prevent accidental treading on any Animal: Wherefore ſome will not ſit down before they have ſwept the place very carefully where they intend to reſt themſelves. They are under one Supreme Head to the number of a hundred thouſand, and wear a piece of Cloth of about four fingers broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Mouthes, with a hole on each ſide, through which they put their Ears.</p>

               <p>Their third Privilege is to read the <hi>Vedam,</hi> and teach it to others; which is forbidden to all elſe, but eſpecially to the Family of the <hi>Weinsja's,</hi> which may neither read it, ſpeak any Words that are in it, nor hear them ſpoken by others; nor may they look into the <hi>Jaſtra,</hi> by which Name all Books are underſtood which treat of Religion.</p>
               <p>Their fourth Privilege is, That they may give Alms if they pleaſe, and ask the Charitable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of others: And though thoſe of other Families may give Alms, yet they are not allow'd to beg.</p>
               <p>

               <p>On the twelfth day they make a <hi>Hamam,</hi> or Fire, which they account Holy, and throwing Myrrhe into it, ſay ſeveral Prayers, After the Fire is extinguiſh'd, they give the Child ſuch a Name as is uſual amongſt them; as <hi>Mainopa, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raina, Beiaewa, Damerſa, Padmanaba, Ragoa, Tirre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, Marlepa, Dewela, Tannopa, Carpa, Wellopa, Rama, Goyenda, Warreda, Weinketi,</hi> or others of that kind.

This making Holes in the Ears is not done to hang Jewels therein, as many do; but is done in compliance with a Promiſe of Obedience made to <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> and <hi>Eſwara,</hi> and for a Teſtimony that they will ever acknowledge them as their Deities, and ever be conſtant in their Religion.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Children of the <hi>Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> are <hi>Brahmans</hi> in reſpect of their Extract, yet they are not ſo accounted before they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Cord call'd <hi>Dſanhem</hi> about their Necks.

                  </note> conſiſting of three Strings, each of nine fine Cotton Threds. None but <hi>Brahmans</hi> make theſe Cords, and onely with their Hands, without a Wheel, or any other Tools. They wear the ſame like a Gold Chain, letting it hang on their left Shoulder, croſs their Breaſts, under their right Arm. About the fifth Year of their Age the <hi>Brahmans</hi> Children begin to wear the ſaid Cord, though they may forbear till they are ten Years old; and commonly thoſe that are of a poor Capacity ſtay till the tenth Year before they wear the <hi>Dſanhem,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put on without a conſiderable Charge; for the foremention'd Fire <hi>Homam,</hi> which is made on a riſing Ground, under a Canopy of ſtretch'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Linnen, muſt be kept lighted four days with the Wood <hi>Rawaſittow</hi> (the Tree whereof they account very holy, and believe that it is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to their Gods) on which every <hi>Brahman</hi> throws Rice in the Ears, alſo ſome boyl'd, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Butter, the Seed <hi>Zingele,</hi> Wheat, and Myrrhe, whilſt they ſay ſeveral Prayers, and uſe many other Ceremonies. Moreover, the Parents of the Children muſt during the time of four days entertain the <hi>Brahmans</hi> which attend the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which ſtands the Nobility in great Sums of Money.</p>
               <p>The Children having received the Cord, which is done in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the Feaſt <hi>Traſwanala Poudewa,</hi> at the Full of the Moon, are call'd <hi>Bramaſory's,</hi> which Name they hold till they marry: Neither may they by vertue of the <hi>Vedam</hi> lie with any Women in that time, nor chew any <hi>Betel,</hi> or eat above once a day, and then of no other Food but what is begg'd, that by their Abſtinence they may be the more capable of Learning.</p>
               <p>This Cord is highly eſteem'd amongſt them; inſomuch that if, age having worn it out, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to break, a <hi>Brahman</hi> is not allow'd to eat or drink before he hath another; for he that hath not a <hi>Dſanhem,</hi> though he be a <hi>Brahman,</hi> is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one amongſt them ſo long as he hath no Cord: Therefore, by way of prevention, they always yearly renew their Cords in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the Feaſt <hi>Tſrawannala Poudewa,</hi> in the time of the Full Moon.</p>

                  <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> and <hi>Eſwara</hi> call'd the <hi>Dewetaes</hi> and <hi>Raetsjasjaes</hi> to Council, to find out an <hi>Elixir,</hi> of which whoever drank ſhould never die, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come immortal. After ſerious conſideration, it was agreed, to throw the Mountain <hi>Merouwa</hi> into the Sea, and there turn it round. In ſtead of a Cord, they took a great Serpent, by them call'd <hi>Sesja.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>After this, there appear'd a moſt beautiful Woman, admir'd and coveted by all; but at laſt <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> took her to himſelf for his Wife; ſhe being call'd <hi>Laetſemi,</hi> hath a place in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> wherein her Image ſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Liquor.</note>Not long after, when they had turn'd the Mountain round ſeveral times, there appear'd that which they had conſulted about; <hi>viz.</hi> the thing which ſhould take away Hunger, Drought, and Faintneſs, and procure Immortality to ſuch as drank thereof. This excellent <hi>Elixir,</hi> by the <hi>Brahmans</hi> call'd <hi>Amortam,</hi> is a Liquor like Milk; wherefore the <hi>Brahmans,</hi> which dare not drink Water in any Houſe, are allow'd to drink Milk.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> had made this diſcovery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to refreſh the faint and wearied <hi>Dewetaes</hi> and <hi>Raetsjasjaes,</hi> he commanded them to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, giving ſome of the <hi>Amortam</hi> out of one Pot to the <hi>Dewetaes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is denied to the <hi>Raetſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jasjaes.</hi>
                  </note> but to the <hi>Raetsjasjaes,</hi> to whom he had not ſo much kindneſs, he gave ſomewhat elſe out of the ſame Pot, which was of no value.<note place="margin">The Sedition of <hi>Kagou</hi> and <hi>Ketou.</hi>

Now by reaſon the Sun and Moon had made that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of them, they were incenſ'd with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hatred againſt them; and when ever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe Luminaries are Eclipſed, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Kagou</hi> and <hi>Ketou</hi> are in Battel with them; and that the darkneſs proceeds from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſwallow'd up for a little while by their Adverſaries, which have the ſhapes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Marriage of the <hi>Brahmans</hi> Children.</note>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> marry their Children very young, eſpecially the Rich; many about their eighth year, and ſome immediately after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Cord <hi>Dſanhem</hi> in their fifth year: for before the receiving of this Cord, neither the <hi>Brahmans, Settreaes,</hi> nor <hi>Weinsjaes</hi> may marry. The Maid muſt always be elder than the Youth, which is ſtrictly obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Brahman</hi> takes ſpecial notice of all things that he meets with in the way when he goes to chuſe a Wife for his Son; and as often as he meets any thing which he judges ominous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, ſo oft he returns, and defers his intent.</p>
               <p>If thoſe of the Family <hi>Weinsja</hi> meet a Serpent on the day when they go to make their firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, they look upon it as an ill omen, giving over their Suit, and will never be brought to renew their Addreſſes, judging that it will prove a moſt unfortunate and bad Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Maidens Fathers, to whom the Addreſſes for Marriage are made, commonly deſire to ſee the Young Man, and make inquiry into his Eſtate; which if they approve, and like the Suitor, then he is permitted to go to her Friends, and to ſee the Maid.</p>
               <p>After the Conſent of both Parties is obtain'd for the Marriage, then a time is appointed, on a Good day, for the Friends to meet to celebrate the Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>When the appointed time of the Marriages is come, then they kindle the Fire <hi>Homam,</hi> made of the Wood of their conſecrated Tree <hi>Rawaſittow;</hi> and a <hi>Boti</hi> or Prieſt repeats ſeveral Prayers. After this, the Bridegroom takes three Handfuls of Rice, which he throws on the Brides Head, who
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63517:91"/>doth the ſame to him; which done, the Brides Father according to his Quality adorns the Bride, and alſo dreſſing the Bridegroom, waſhes his Feet.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Father taking his Daughter by the Hand, puts into ſame Water (if he be rich) Money and Jewels, and gives it to the Bridgroom in the Name of God, ſaying, <hi>I have nothing more to do with you; I here give her to you.</hi> When the Father gives his Daughers Hand to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; he alſo gives with her a Precious Gem call'd <hi>Tali,</hi> which being a Golden Head of an Idol faſtned to a String, is ſhew'd to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and, after ſome Prayers, and Good Wiſhes, is by the Bridgroom tied about the Brides Neck; and this confirms the Marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Marriage proclaim'd.</note>All theſe Ceremonies are perform'd in the Brides Father's Houſe; beſides which, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Marriage (becauſe it is a Buſineſs which concerne the Publick Good; and a thing neceſſary to be known) is openly proclaim'd, and notified to all Perſons: For before they confirm the Marriage, ſome days before the celebrating thereof, they ſet an Arbor as a Sign before the Bride's Door, as alſo four <hi>Piſang</hi> Trees, if they can get them. This Canopy is properly four erected Poles, which being about ſeven Foot high, are cover'd on the top with ſmall Sticks, on which they lay green Boughs, and wind the Poles round about with <hi>Piſang</hi> Leaves in ſign of joy.</p>

               <p>The Married Children of the <hi>Brahmans</hi> are no more call'd <hi>Brahmaſaries,</hi> but <hi>Garhaſta's,</hi> when they receive a ſecond Cord, conſiſting of three Strings like the firſt. Every ten years that they increaſe in their age, they add another Cord to the former, and alſo another at the Birth of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child: But this is not ſo exactly obſerv'd by all; yet the more zealous they are in their Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, the more ſtrictly they oblige themſelves to theſe Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">They marry not out of their own Tribe.</note>They never marry their Children, whether Sons or Daughters, to any but thoſe of their own Family; which thoſe of other Tribes alſo obſerve, unleſs to thoſe of a higher Degree: But the <hi>Brahmans</hi> cannot be deceiv'd thereby, becauſe there are none above them. Yet there are ſome <hi>Brahmans</hi> which marry Wives out of other Tribes, but it is accounted ſo heinous a ſin, that their Companions believe they can never be admitted into Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Poranes</hi> or Ancient Hiſtories alſo relate, That a <hi>Brahman</hi> of great Quality, call'd <hi>Sandra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goupeti Naraia,</hi> was very melancholy in his old age, becauſe his Son <hi>Barthrouherri</hi> was born of a Woman of the <hi>Soudran</hi> Family; for he afterwards had familiarity with three hundred Women.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Abhor Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>They abhor Fornication, accounting it one of the five deadly ſins; and, according to their <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> he that ſo tranſgreſſes ſhould have his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals cut off, and ſo bleed to death: Alſo they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none to marry within the Degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity: But they differ very much from the <hi>European</hi> Nations in reckoning their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Allies with whom they are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to marry; for they are allow'd to marry with their firſt Wifes Siſter, nay, they may marry two, three, or more Siſters at once; but if two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers marry two Siſters, it is accounted Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They may alſo marry their Fathers Siſters Daughter; but not their Fathers Brothers Daughter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> ſeldom deſert their Wives, though taken in the act of Adultery; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould not be publiſh'd, and ſo redownd to their diſgrace; and partly out of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection which they bear to their Wives, and therefore endeavor to keep all their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſecret: But if it be known,<note place="margin">A Womans Puniſhment offending in ſuch caſe.</note> and civil Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereupon avoid coming to the Houſe, and they, on the contrary, out of an affection to their Wives, have a mind to enjoy them honourably, then they makes a great Feaſt, to which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite many <hi>Brahmans</hi> and <hi>Sanjaſys,</hi> on whom the Adultereſs is to wait at the Table, which they look upon as a ſufficient Puniſhment for her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

According to theſe <hi>Panjangams</hi> the People of this Countrey govern themſelves, they being made new every Year, like our Almanacks. The laſt are very exact; for they make Obſervations on every one of the ſixty Hours, whereinto, according to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Day and Night is divided; declaring whether they are fortunate or not, and what may be done or let alone in every Hour; for which they highly eſteem this <hi>Panjangam,</hi> ſuppoſing it infallible.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their good and bad days.</note>As to what concerns the Good and Bad Days, the <hi>Amawaſi,</hi> or firſt Day after the laſt Quarter of the Moon, is good: The <hi>Padeni,</hi> or firſt Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New Moon, before it is ſeen, is bad; as on the contrary, the <hi>Widdia,</hi> or Day on which the Moon firſt appears, is good: The fourth Day, and the <hi>Lecadeſi,</hi> or ninth Day after the New Moon, are both bad; as alſo the eleventh, their Faſt-day, if it happens on a <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> but good, if on another day. And thus they reckon their Good and Bad Days throughout the whole Year, going from the Full to the New Moon. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they judge of the Hours and Minutes by the Accidents that happen to them, and narrowly obſerve the ſame.</p>
               <p>They all account it a good Omen when the Bird <hi>Garrouda</hi> (which is a reddiſh Hawk, with a white Circle about his Neck) or the Bird <hi>Pala,</hi> flie from their right to their left ſide, or before them as they walk: But the contrary in other Birds; for if they flie before them croſs the way, from the left hand to the right, it is a good ſign; and a bad one, if from the right to the left. If
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63517:91"/>any be touch'd by Jackdaw (of which there are many here in this Countrey) flying, it is a very bad Omen; and they certainly believe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Party which is to touch'd, or ſome of his Relations will infallibly die within ſix Weeks. To Sneeze as they travel is accounted very ill, inſomuch that if it happen in any Houſe, they will ſurely turn back.

               <p>At the ſide of the Pit is a little riſing Aſcent made, on which ſhe ſits down againſt the Mats, and takes leave of her Relations and Friends, who ſtill encourage her Undertaking.

                  <note place="margin">A ſtrange Marriage of Bulls and Cows.</note>Theſe Heathens have another ridiculous and unheard of Cuſtom about this Beaſt, eſpecially in <hi>Surat; viz.</hi> they marry Bulls and Cows to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether publickly, with many Ceremonies, after this manner. The Beaſts having a Rope tied about their Necks, are led to a River, where the Prieſt waſheth their Heads. Then the Prieſt ſtanding on the Shore, makes ſtrange Signs to them with his Hands, whilſt the Owners of the Beaſts making a Fire of dry'd Cow-dung, ſet themſelves round about it: Whereupon the Prieſt alſo drawing near the Fire, throws in Sandal-wood, Benjamin, and Aloes. Then going to the Water again, the Beaſts are brought before him, and held ſo as that their fore-legs may ſtand on the Shore, and the hindermoſt in the Water; whilſt the Prieſt taking off the old Ropes that a were about their Necks, puts on new. This done, they hold the Beaſts Mouthes cloſe together, while the Prieſt marks them with a yellow Stroke in the Forehead.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Prieſt reads many ſtrange Prayers out of a Book; which done, he throws ſeveral Perfumes into a Copper Pan full of glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals, with which he ſmokes the new-married Beaſts under their Heads, Bellies, and Tails; then he goes again praying about the Fire, and at laſt perfumes the Tails of both, which are held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If by chance the Beaſts, during this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, happen to urine, the Women ſtrive one with another to catch it, ſome with Pots, others with their Hands, and drink it; for they eſteem this Water holy, and good for a barren Womb.</p>
               <p>After this Marriage and Ceremonies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, the Beaſts are led home again, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a great number of Men, Women, and Children, who make a Feaſt. <hi>Texeira</hi> tells us, That a <hi>Benjan</hi> Merchant ſpent 12000 Ducats at the Marriage of his Cow with a Bull of his Neighbors.</p>
               <p>Moreover, at ſome Seaſons they have a Cuſtom to feed their Cows with unthreſh'd Rice; which done, they waſh their Dung in a Sieve, and dry thoſe Corns which are undigeſted, and remain in the Sieve; which Corns being afterwards conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Prieſt, are accounted holy, and being made into Cakes, and bak'd, are given to ſick People for a wonderful Medicine.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Why the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> have Cows in great eſteem.</note>The <hi>Indians</hi> ſhew this great reverence to a Cow for three ſpecial Reaſons. The firſt is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe, that the Souls of the Pious, which have liv'd juſtly, and ſuch as God will not puniſh in this World, are tranſmigrated into theſe Beaſts. Secondly, Becauſe, with the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> they believe, That the Foundation of the World is ſupported onely on the Horns of theſe Beaſts, by them call'd <hi>Behemoth,</hi> which name they have taken out of <hi>Job;</hi> and that when the Cow moves any faſter than ordinary, it occaſions Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. Thirdly, When <hi>Mahadeu,</hi> being on a time highly incens'd by reaſon of the many ſins which the People had committed, had reſolv'd to deſtroy the World, a Cow appeaſing him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Pardon for all their ſins, and deliver'd the World from utter ruine.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this their abſtaining from Fleſh, and from killing of Beaſts, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeem to have ſuck'd out of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Doctrine, if it was not cuſtomary amongſt them before; for <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> after the ſame manner, and by reaſon he believ'd the Tranſmigration of Souls, forbade alſo his Scholars to eat Fleſh.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> forbid the eating of Fleſh, and why.</note>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> alſo maintain, That the eating of Fleſh is not to be allow'd, becauſe it cannot be done without forcing the Soul from the Body, which they account a horrid ſin. And as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a ſin to kill a Man or Woman, becauſe thereby is occaſion'd a ſeparation of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for the ſame reaſon, ſay they, it is ſin to kill any Beaſt, ſince by the death thereof the Soul is ſeparated from the Body, and neceſſitated to paſs to another, whereby its condition is not made better, but worſe; for the Soul which formerly reſided in a Cow, might chance to be tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into the Body of ſome deſpis'd Beaſt or Plant: For the <hi>Brahmans</hi> believe, That not onely the Souls of Men tranſmigrate into Beaſts, but alſo into Trees and Herbs; and that Humane Creatures, Beaſts, Trees, and Plants, have all one and the ſame Soul, and differ onely in the outward appearance of the Body.</p>

               <p>But the <hi>Settrea's,</hi> on the contrary, affirm, That they do better than the <hi>Brahmans,</hi> who diſturb many Souls, by plucking divers Herbs out of the Ground to feed one Perſon; when as they, by killing a Beaſt, diſturb onely one, to feed many People. But the <hi>Brahmans</hi> anſwer, That they by the pulling of many Herbs out of the Ground, do not ſin ſo much as the <hi>Settrea's</hi> by killing of one Goat; becauſe the Souls which reſide in Herbs are in the meaneſt condition, and by their tranſmigation remove into nobler Bodies, as Men or Beaſts. Nevertheleſs, they pretend that they would, if it were poſſible, live without Food, ſo to prevent the diſturbing of any Soul. Yet few amongſt them are ſo exact, but freely eat of the Fruits, Herbs, Roots, and Plants which the Earth produces, judging they may do it without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: But they will never eat of any thing that had life, chuſing rather to die of Hunger.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> are very moderate in their Diet, and have no peculiar Dainties; nor do they uſe to drink Wine, or any other ſtrong Liquor; but their common Drink is clear Water, without any kind of mixture: yet ſometimes, with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, they drink a Draught of Milk at Meals, with which to ſupply them moſt People of Note keep Cows.</p>
               <p>Their uſual Food is Rice, Plants, and Herbs, according to the Seaſon of the Year. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely abhor Drunkenneſs and account it one of their five Mortal Sins.</p>
               <p>Thoſe amongſt them who perform the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Offices, and do the greateſt Lahor, have the moſt freedom allow'd them in their Diet, becauſe they require the moſt Suſtenance, which makes many of them not ſcruple to drink Wine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brahmans,</hi> out of a high eſteem or ſelf-conceit of themſelves, will in no wiſe be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to eat or drink any thing in a Houſe inhabited by one of another Tribe, but onely <hi>Teyer,</hi> that is, thick Milk; becauſe they account that to be a ſort of <hi>Amortam,</hi> or <hi>Nectar of the Gods:</hi> Nay, a <hi>Brahman</hi> will not eat in another <hi>Brahman's</hi> Houſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63517:94"/>that is of a different Sect; and if a <hi>Byahman</hi> be Marry'd to a Woman of another Family, ſhe is not allow'd to eat with, nor to ſee him eat; but if a Man out of love to his Wife, permit her to eat with him, and other <hi>Brahmans</hi> are informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they will not onely reſent it very ill, but ſhun the Houſe of ſuch a Perſon, and account him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their Society.</p>

Some are ſo vainly curious, that they will not eat in a place where another of a contrary Sect or Tribe hath Din'd or Supp'd before the Floor is rubb'd over with Ox-dung, which they believe cleanſes it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> never eat with any of another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor will they drink out of one Cup with them, but ſhun their company; and, endeavor by all means poſſible to avoid touching of them, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be defil'd thereby; nay, an <hi>Indian</hi> of great Quality will not onely refuſe to eat with another of a lower Degree, out will not be touch'd by him, and if he ſhould accidentally, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cleanſe his Body, by rubbing it with Herbs.</p>
               <p>The common People ſhew great reverence and obedience to their Nobility: for meeting them in the Street, they not onely give them the Way, but run from one ſide of the Street to the other like mad Men, for fear of touching them; nay, the Noblemen, if they did otherwiſe, would beat them into better manners.</p>
               <p>In regard no <hi>Indian</hi> will drink with another of a different Opinion out of one and the ſame Cup, for fear of being defil'd, therefore when they are in the Field, and have but one Cup, with which they are forc'd to make ſhift, they have found out a means not to defile one another by drinking together, <hi>viz.</hi> they touch not the Cup with their Lips, but holding it with one Hand a pretty diſtance from their Mouths, pouring the Liquor therein very dexterouſly, not ſpilling a drop.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Diet of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                  </note>As to what concerns the Meat and Drink of the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is ſeveral, according to the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Countrey, but moſt <hi>Indians</hi> uſe boyl'd Rice in ſtead of Bread. The <hi>Coco</hi>-tree is the chief and onely thing of their ſubſiſtence: for it affords Fruit, Oyl, Milk, Honey, Vinegar, and Wine. The greateſt Delicacy amongſt the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is Rice boyl'd with green Ginger, and mix'd with a little Pepper and Butter. Their ordinary Food is of wheaten Flowr, but of a certain courſe Grain, though well taſted, which they make up into great round and thick Cakes, and bake them on thin Iron Plates, which they carry with them from one place to another when they travel; they ſpread a little Butter on theſe Cakes, and ſo eat them.</p>
               <p>They have alſo a certain Diſh call'd <hi>Maſſack,</hi> or <hi>Matſack,</hi> which is made of two parts Water, and one of Brandy, ſome Eggs, beaten Cinamon, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and Bread, which is boyl'd like a Poſſet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baril</hi> is a Broth which the <hi>Indians</hi> make of the Juice or Milk of <hi>Coco-nuts</hi> and Butter, with all manner of Spices, and amongſt others, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom, Ginger, Herbs, Fruit, and ſeveral other Ingredients. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> adde to the ſame the Fleſh of Hens and Chickens chopt in ſmall pieces, which they lay upon the Rice, that is boyl'd onely with Water and Salt.</p>
               <p>They alſo boyl the Root <hi>Curcuma</hi> with their Meat and almoſt throughout all <hi>India</hi> they boyl no Meat without a little Bundle of Cammels Hay, in <hi>Greek</hi> call'd <hi>Schoenanthos,</hi> to give it a ſavory taſte, and to fortifie the Stomach, as alſo a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63517:95"/>of <hi>Calamus Aromaticus,</hi> or <hi>Nard,</hi> in the <hi>Malaian</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Diringo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> in many places have alſo a delicate Diſh, or rather Sawce, to procure an Appetite, which is call'd <hi>Achor</hi> or <hi>Aſtjar,</hi> and is us'd there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as here our Gurkins, Olives, and Capers; it is likewiſe brought from thence into <hi>Europe,</hi> where many People eat it with much delight, it being made of Cucumbers, <hi>Mangos</hi> or long Pepper, Garlick, green Ginger Roots, and the young juicy Sprigs of Canes, which are laid in Pickle with Vinegar, Pepper and other Spices. The Bunches of green Pepper are alſo laid in Pickle, and brought to the Table either with roaſt or boyl'd Meat as likewiſe the Roots of green Ginger and <hi>Galanſe,</hi> beſides the Fruit <hi>Manga, Carambolas, Aſtjae, Billinbing, Curcuma;</hi> likewiſe Gurkins, Melons, and Pumpions in ſtead of Capers and Olives, which in <hi>Zurratte</hi> and other places, are alſo in great abundance.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Indians</hi> alſo eat that kind of Apple, call'd in <hi>Latine Pomum Amoris,</hi> and <hi>Pomum Aureum,</hi> and by the <hi>Portugueſe, Pomod' Oro,</hi> which is a ſort of <hi>Mandragora,</hi> or Mandrake cold in the third degree; though ſome put <hi>Achay,</hi> or <hi>Braſilian</hi> Pepper, in the <hi>Malaian</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Lada Chili,</hi> that is, <hi>Pepper from Chili,</hi> which is very hot, to temper the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Cold thereof, and pouring Oyl and Vinegar over them, eat the ſame with roaſted Fleſh or Fiſh. Some accuſtom themſelves to chew <hi>Achay</hi> juſt as ſome People chew Tobacco. Theſe golden Apples are ſometimes Preſerv'd with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; but the <hi>Chineſes</hi> on the Iſland <hi>Java,</hi> roaſting them in Aſhes, eat them with Pepper and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. The Fruits <hi>Carambolas</hi> are alſo for the ſame purpoſe laid in Pickle.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their ſeveral ſorts of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</note>The Drink which is commonly drunk by the Vulgar, is Water; but People of note, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Moors,</hi> mix Cinamon Juice and Sugar with their Water, which being a pleaſant Liquor, is call'd <hi>Scherbet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many places they drink in ſtead of Wine, a Liquor which is tapt out of the Palm-tree, into a Pot which hangs at it a whole Night. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> call this Wine <hi>Vinho de Palma,</hi> that is, <hi>Palm-wine;</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Cambaya, Tari</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri;</hi> others, <hi>Sura</hi> and <hi>Toddy;</hi> and the <hi>Amboynans, Towack.</hi> This Liquor is of a white colour, and ſomewhat thick, and of a tart, yet pleaſant taſte, intoxicating the Brain like Wine, if drank to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but if moderately, it is accounted an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicine againſt the Dropſie. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tap this Liquor out of the Tree after Sun-ſet, letting their Veſſels hang to the ſame till Sun-riſing, for then it keeps ſweet and pleaſant all the day after: for that which is tapt in the day-time is not ſo delightful to the Palate, but is flat and eager; which is occaſion'd by the heat of the Sun, and is good for nothing but to make Vinegar, for which it is us'd by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this Liquor <hi>Tara</hi> or <hi>Terri,</hi> which of it ſelf drops out of the Trees, they make another ſort of Wine, by the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Uraca,</hi> which is the onely Wine of all <hi>India,</hi> and being of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, is very hot and ſtrong, which the <hi>Indians</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs drink like Water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> temper this Wine, by putting ſton'd Raiſins into the Veſſel, which they do not ſtop cloſe, but leave the Bung-hole open, leaſt by reaſon of the extraordinary heat and ſtrength the Fat ſhould flie aſunder, becauſe it ferments like boyling Water. Every day for a fortnight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſtir this Liquor, after which it becomes of a deep Red, and is of a ſweetiſh taſte. They alſo drink abundance of the freſh Juice, which is inclos'd within the <hi>Coco</hi>-nuts.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Liquor call'd <hi>Zaguer,</hi> brought from <hi>Banda</hi> and the <hi>Molucko</hi> Iſles, which drops out of a Tree not unlike the <hi>Coco.</hi> But this Liquor is very unwholſom to drink, eſpecially for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for it not onely occaſions a great Looſneſs, but alſo a kind of dead Palſie, call'd by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Beribery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have likewiſe a very ſtrong Liquor like Brandy, call'd <hi>Arack,</hi> made of the Moiſture that is inclos'd in the <hi>Coco</hi>-nuts, and alſo of that which drops out of the Tree it ſelf, which they burn with Rice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſes,</hi> to make the moſt of their Rice, adulterate the ſame, by putting into it a ſort of poiſonous Weed, which drives upon the Sea, whereby the <hi>Arack</hi> receives a corroding Heat, very prejudicial to the Lungs, and cauſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, vomiting of Blood, and other deadly Diſtempers, eſpecially to all Strangers that drink thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in many places have a Liquor which they make of Spring-water, <hi>Javanſagar, Tamarinds,</hi> and Lemmons, which they put all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Veſſel hoop'd with Iron Hoops, and ſtopping it very cloſe, let it ſtand twenty four hours in the Sun, whereby throwing the Droſs and Filth upwards, it becomes a moſt excellent Liquor, almoſt like <hi>March</hi> Beer.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in moſt places of <hi>India</hi> a certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is made call'd <hi>Palipuntz,</hi> which by ſome is made after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> they take half Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and half Water, into which they put Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cinamon, Sugar, and Line Juice.</p>
               <p>This Liquor, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call'd <hi>Punch,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtful to <hi>European</hi> Bodies, if drank exceſſively, for it occaſions Looſneſs.</p>
               <p>Some alſo drink a Brewage made onely of clear Water and brown Sugar, which if drunk in hot Weather is very unwholſome, but is much tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, if a Draught of the Liquor <hi>Palipuntz</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they diſtill a kind of Brandy out of Dates, Sugar, and Palm-wine.</p>
               <p>Perſons of Quality in the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Countrey drink <hi>Chiraſſan</hi> Wine, for they have no Wine of their own, there being no Vines planted in all <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>About <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Dely,</hi> along the Stream <hi>Gemna,</hi> as far as the Mountains, as alſo on each ſide of the High-way, which runs to <hi>Lahor,</hi> is a large quantity of untill'd Land; ſome parts are wooddy, others overgrown with Graſs of a Man's heighth. In all theſe places are many Game-keepers, who go from place to place, to prevent Hunting or Hawking there, except for Partridges, Quails, and Hares, which the <hi>Indians</hi> catch in Gins or Snares; ſo that there are abundance of wild Beaſts in all places. When theſe Keepers of the Game know that the King or <hi>Mogol</hi> is in the Field a Hunting, and near their Station they acquaint the chief Maſter Huntſman with the quality of the Beaſt which is Hunted, and where there are moſt of them; whereupon all the Avenues to that place are guarded, that Travellers may not go through that place, but paſs by on one ſide or other. They Hunt ſeveral Beaſts, as <hi>Gazelles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Beaſts they chiefly Hunt.</note> 
                  <hi>Nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaux,</hi> or grey Oxen, Lyons, Cranes, and others. They Hunt <hi>Gazelles</hi> with tame Leopards after this manner: When they diſcover a Herd of <hi>Gazelles</hi> (for they commonly graze five or ſix in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) they unchain the Leopard, that lay Chain'd in a little Wagon where they are kept; he being let looſe, doth not immediately run at them, but goes creeping along to hide himſelf, till the <hi>Gazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> paſſing by, he leaps with incredible ſwiftneſs upon them, and ſeizing one of them, ſtrangles the ſame, ſatisfying himſelf by onely ſucking the Blood, and tearing out the Heart and Liver; but if he miſſes his prey, which often happens, then he ſtands ſtill, very well knowing it to be in vain to run after them, becauſe they are much ſwifter than himſelf: When the Game is ended, the Keeper approaches by Degrees, ſtroaks the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, and throwing the Fleſh to him, blinds his Eyes, putting on his Chain, and ſo conveys him into the Wagon again.</p>
               <p>The catching of the <hi>Nilgaux,</hi> or grey Oxen, which are a kind of Buffalo's, is of no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: for they ſurround them with a ſtrong Net, which they cloſe by degrees, and having brought them into a narrow compaſs, the King, with his <hi>Omrahs</hi> and Husbandmen ſtepping in, kill them as they pleaſe, either by throwing Darts at them, or with Bullets, Arrows, and Swords, and in ſuch great numbers, that the King ſends whole Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof for Preſents to his <hi>Omrahs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:63517:96"/>
               <p>In their catching of Cranes it is very pleaſant, to ſee how theſe Fowls defend themſelves againſt the Birds of prey, whom ſometimes they kill, but very often get from them, becauſe the Hawks or Falcons are not ſo nimble as they in turning and winding.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The manner of Hunting the Lyon by the <hi>Great Mogol.</hi>
                  </note>But of all their Hunting, that of the Lyon is not onely the moſt Royal (for none but the King and Princes may perform the ſame without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial permiſſion) but alſo the moſt dangerous, and is perform'd after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> When the King is in the Field, and the Keepers thereof have diſcover'd the place where the Lyon keeps, they tie an Aſs to a Tree near the ſame; the Lyon coming out and devouring the Aſs, goes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unmoleſted to ſeek for ſome other prey, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Oxen, Sheep, or whatſoever he can light on; then going to drink, he comes back to his old place, and there reſts till the next day; when co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth again, he finds another Aſs in the ſame place, ty'd there by the Keepers; having fed him thus for ſeveral days together, at laſt, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King is to come to Hunt, they tie another Aſs in the ſame place, having firſt given it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Opium,</hi> that the Fleſh thereof may make the Lyon ſleep the better; then calling in all the Ruſticks thereabouts, they incloſe the Lyon within ſtrong Nets made for that purpoſe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame by degrees to a ſmall circumference, as they do in catching the <hi>Nilgaux;</hi> this done, and all things in readineſs, the King mounts on an Elephant, Arm'd with Iron Plates, in company of the chief Maſter Huntſman and ſome <hi>Omrahs,</hi> all likewiſe mounted on Elephants, ſeveral <hi>Gourze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdars,</hi> and many other Huntſmen on foot, Arm'd with Half-pikes and Muſquets; in which manner approaching the Net, they fire at the Lyon, who when he feels himſelf wounded, comes directly, according to the cuſtom, to one of the Elephants, but finds himſelf intangled in the Net, where the King ſhoots at him ſo long till he hath kill'd him. But ſome Lyons have often been known to leap over the Net, to the deſtruction of many People. The <hi>Indians</hi> account it a good Omen when the King kills a Lyon, and a very bad one when he miſſes him, believing the whole State to be in danger if he doth not deſtroy him. They alſo uſe great Ceremony at the end of this Hunting: for the dead Lyon is brought before the King in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> who after they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly view'd and meaſur'd it, give an account thereof to the Secretary to Regiſter the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a King, at ſuch a time, kill'd a Lyon of ſuch a bigneſs, and ſuch colour'd Hair, and having Teeth and Claws of ſuch a length, and all other Circumſtances whatever.</p>
               <p>In <hi>India</hi> they uſe no Torches or Links, as we do here, but Copper Fire-pans, almoſt like thoſe which in ſeveral Paintings are ſeen held by infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Furies. In theſe Pans they feed the Fire with Pitch, and the like, which makes a great Flame. A Servant commonly carries this Fire-pan in a Copper Caſe, with a very long and narrow Neck in ſtead of a Handle, by which he holds the ſame, and ſtill feeds the Flame With freſh Matter.</p>

               <p>According to Mr. <hi>Edward Terry,</hi> the Vulgar Tongue of the Countrey of <hi>Indoſtan</hi> hath great Affinity with the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongues; but is pleaſanter and eaſier to pronounce. It is a very fluent Language, expreſſing many things in few words. They write and read like us, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Left to the Right Hand.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Court-Language is wholly <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
                  </note>In <hi>India,</hi> and the Countreys under the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Juriſdiction, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue is more common <hi>Indian,</hi> being generally ſpoken by the Nobility at Court, and us'd in all Publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Writings; which cannot ſeem ſtrange to any, conſidering the <hi>Mogollean</hi> Princes have their Extract from <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>Samarcand,</hi> whence the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue was firſt brought.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Linſchot</hi> tells us, That many People of divers Nations, which came to build the City, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in <hi>Malacka,</hi> made this peculiar Language of all the other <hi>Indian</hi> Tongues, conſiſting of the moſt pleaſing Words, and neateſt manner and way of ſpeaking, of all other the Neighboring People; which makes this Language to be the beſt and moſt eloquent of all <hi>India,</hi> and alſo the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and eaſieſt to learn: For there is not one Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant which comes from the neighboring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys to Trade here, but learns this Tongue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Netherland Eaſt-India Company</hi> have lately printed a Dictionary of the Common Diſcourſe in that Tongue, as alſo the New Teſtament, and other Books, in the ſame Language.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Creation of the World.</note>THe Creation of the World (as we have already mention'd) the <hi>Brahmans</hi> aſcribe to one <hi>Bramma,</hi> by the Power given him from <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> or <hi>Mahadeu:</hi> But theſe People reſt not in the making of one; for they form di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers imaginary Worlds, which in the form of an Egg drive on the Water, which being without the Principal World, is God himſelf, as ſhall be declared hereafter more at large.</p>
               <p>Some have not ſtuck to affirm. That <hi>Bramma</hi> made fourteen Worlds, agreeing with the Parts of Humane Bodies; <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt, and uppermoſt Celeſtial World, out of the Brain; the ſecond, out of the Eyes; the third, out of the Mouth; the fourth, out of the Left Ear; the fifth, out of the Roof of the Mouth; the ſixth, out of the Heart; the ſeventh, out of the Belly; the eighth, out of the Privities; the ninth, out of the Left Thigh; the tenth, out of the Knees; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, out of the Legs; the twelfth, out of the Toes of the Right Foot; the thirteenth, out of the Toes of the Left Foot; and the fourteenth, out of the Air round about him. Out of theſe Worlds he alſo created Man, according to the qualities of Humane Bodies: <hi>viz.</hi> Out of the firſt he created Men with Prudence and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; out of the ſecond, with Conduct in Tranſitory things; out of the third, good Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; out of the fourth, ſubtile and crafty People; out of the fifth, Gluttons and debauch'd Perſons; out of the ſixth, Noble and Famous Men; out of the ſeventh, Slovens and Ill-natur'd: out of the eighth, Laſcivious and Venerial Humoriſts; out of the ninth, Handicrafts and Husband-men; out of the tenth, Gard'ners and Ruſticks; out of the eleventh, poor Laborers; out of the twelfth, Murderers, Robbers, and Thieves; out of the thirteenth, Oppreſſors of the Poor; and out of the fourteenth, People endued with all manner of excellent qualities.</p>
               <p>In this manner they deſcribe the great <hi>Bramma,</hi> Creator of ſo many People and Worlds; which they believe ſo firmly in every particular, that they repreſent his Image in all their <hi>Pagodes</hi> or Temples, with a Circle on every of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Parts, in ſtead of a World.</p>
               <p>The World (as we ſaid before) they affirm to drive on the Waters in the form of an Egg, which incloſes Heaven, Earth, and Hell.</p>
               <p>In this Egg they alſo know how to find the fourteen Parts of the World. Under the Earth they place <hi>Patalam,</hi> that is, <hi>The Infernal Pit;</hi> above it, the <hi>Surgam,</hi> that is, <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Brammar-Lokon;</hi> and above that, <hi>Kailoſom, Lilaweicontam,</hi> and <hi>Weicontam;</hi> in which three laſt Places, they ſay, God himſelf reſides. The Earth, or Globe of the World which we inhabit, they call <hi>Boulocon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Boulocon,</hi> ſay they, comprehends ſeven Worlds more, each ſeparated from the other by a Sea. The World ſeated at the Center, they ſay, is ſurrounded with a Sea of clear, ſweet Water; the next to it, with a Sea of Milk, on which they make the Mountain <hi>Tricoweta</hi> ſtand, which is 10000 Leagues high and as many broad; the third, with a Sea of Butter; the fourth, with a Sea of <hi>Tayer,</hi> or Cream; the fifth, with a Sea of Wine; the ſixth, with a Sea of Syrrup; the ſeventh, with a Sea of Salt Water, which is our World; all which have their Names from thoſe Seas which ſurround them.</p>
               <p>According to others, there are ſeven Seas in this our World alone, <hi>viz.</hi> one of Water, one of Milk, one of Cream, one of Butter, one of Salt, one of Sugar, and one of Wine.</p>

No ſooner was <hi>Praſſeram</hi> departed from his Father, but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf down on the Ground, he laid his Legs acroſs under him, with a ſtedfaſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſit in that poſture twelve years, and ſpend all that time in Praying to <hi>Mahadeu.</hi> Mean while <hi>Reneka</hi> ſerv'd her Husband with her utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and the Love between them grew to that heighth, that next to <hi>Mahadeu,</hi> there was nothing which ſhe affected more than <hi>Siamdichemi;</hi> when at laſt the mighty <hi>Ragia Siſtraerſim</hi> going a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his whole Retinue, which made a ſmall Army, and ranged through ſeveral Hills, Dales, Woods, and Mountains, came at laſt to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ganges,</hi> and knowing the Wood where his Wives Siſter and her Husband dwelt, reſolv'd to viſit him with his whole Train, commanding all his People to pack up their travelling Apparel, and other things, and Lodge with him at <hi>Siamdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemi</hi>'s Habitation: Immediately after all things were made ready, they entred into the pious <hi>Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dichemi</hi>'s Hut, and found him in a deep ſleep, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he wak'd not with all their noiſe, as beating of Drums, ſounding of Horns, and bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dogs; but his Wife taking warm Water, waſh'd the Crown of his Head therewith, and ſo wak'd him. <hi>Ragia Siſtraerſim</hi> having ſaluted <hi>Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dichemi,</hi> told him, that he had heard much of his religious Life, which had brought him thither, with intention to lie there that Night with all his Followers, and to Sup with him. <hi>Siamdichemi</hi> was not a little troubled hereat, not knowing how to feed ſo many thouſand People; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>Ragia Inder</hi> kept the white Cow <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doga,</hi> and that thoſe which have the ſame in their Houſe ſhould want for nothing, he therefore earneſtly implor'd <hi>Inder</hi> to lend him the ſame for a ſmall time, that theſe People might ſee what it was to be pious, and that the Religious never want for any thing. <hi>Inder</hi> granting his Requeſt, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent the white Cow, with Orders to run directly through the Woods to <hi>Samdichemi</hi>'s poor Hut, where coming, ſhe was by him receiv'd, and ty'd by a ſmall Cord.

Next he ask'd for Clothes, not onely for himſelf, but for all his Attendants, which he likewiſe fetch'd out of his Hut, and all things elſe which he requeſted, beſides a great Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to each of his Servants; which the <hi>Ragia</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, ſtay'd with him that Night, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Day. When it was time to eat, they wanted neither Meat nor Drink, but whatſoever they deſir'd was brought them. After the ſame manner they were Entertain'd the third day. The mighty <hi>Ragia Siſtraerſim</hi> could not admire ſufficiently from whence all the Riches, Clothes, Meat and Drink was brought: for that which <hi>Siamdichemi</hi> had already expended, amounted to a very great Sum of Money, his Houſe or Hut not being able to contain a third part of the Goods, which he had diſtributed amongſt them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ragia</hi> ſuppos'd that the Hut ſtood over a deep Pit, out of which all things were brought, and to diſcover it he ſent Spyes, who looking through a Creviſs, ſaw the foremention'd Cow, which vomited all theſe things out of her Mouth; which they told <hi>Ragia;</hi> who taking his leave the next day, and being ask'd by <hi>Siſtraerſim</hi> if he had receiv'd ſatisfaction in his Entertainment, and if he deſir'd ought elſe? <hi>Ragia</hi> reply'd, <hi>Nothing but the white Cow which is in your Hut;</hi> which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly troubled him, and being amaz'd, anſwer'd, That ſhe was none of his own, and therefore he could not give her away: <hi>How!</hi> (ſaid <hi>Siſtraerſim</hi>) <hi>Do you now refuſe to give me this Cow, whenas you have given me ſo many excellent things before?</hi> To which <hi>Siamdichemi</hi> reply'd, <hi>The other was in my power, but this is not.</hi> To which <hi>Siſtraerſim</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>Do you not know my might and power, that though you refuſe me the Cow, I can immediately take her away by force?</hi> and immediately calling his Men together, commanded the ſtouteſt to take away the Cow from <hi>Siamdichemi,</hi> who ſeeing her thus pull'd away, cry'd aloud, <hi>Whether do you go? how ſhall I pacifie</hi> Ragia Inder? <hi>do not ſuffer your ſelf to be thus carry'd away for a ſpoil, but take revenge at once of yours and my Enemies.</hi> The Cow hearing theſe words, and being provok'd thereby, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately became thrice as big as ſhe was before, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63517:107"/>began to trample and to puſh down many of them, inſomuch that ſeveral thouſands were kill'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by her Horns, or elſe trodden to death under her Feet; after which ſhe immediately fled to the Habitation of <hi>Ragia Inder. Siſtraerſim</hi> ſeeing ſuch a deſtruction made amongſt his Followers, and the Cow out of his power flown into the Skie, believ'd that his Brother-in-law had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately utter'd ſome conjuring words, which made the Cow do him ſo much miſchief, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly incens'd, ſaid to his Attendants, <hi>Come, let us all go back to the curſed Hut of</hi> Siamdichemi, <hi>for I will not depart hence, till I have reveng'd my ſelf by his Death:</hi> Accordingly they with all their force fell upon his Hut, and as a Reward for all his kindneſs in Entertaining him and his Retinue for three days together, and giving him ſo many rich Preſents, moſt cruelly and ungratefully beat out his Brains. The unfortunate <hi>Reneka</hi> ſeeing her beloved Husband thus inhumanely murther'd, fetch'd the Corps into her Hut, where laying the ſame in her Lap, ſhe reſolv'd not to live long after him, but ſetting fire on the Hut, burnt her ſelf, and mix'd her Aſhes with thoſe of her Husbands. Mean while the Cow coming near <hi>Ragia Inder</hi>'s Habitation, met with <hi>Praſſeram,</hi> who asking her from whence ſhe came, was told, That upon <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Inder</hi>'s Command ſhe had been at his Father's Houſe; and alſo related what had hapned there, <hi>viz.</hi> how ill <hi>Siſtraerſim</hi> had rewarded his Father for his extraordinary kindneſs, and how treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly he was murther'd: Whereupon <hi>Praſſeram</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Let me die, if I do not revenge this one and twenty times over, and deſtroy all the Ketteries;</hi> now the <hi>Ketteries</hi> were a very wicked People, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more pious <hi>Brahmans</hi> than ever the Giants and Deities had done. Wherefore <hi>Mahadeu</hi> having long before reſolv'd to root out the <hi>Ketteries,</hi> he gave the greater ſtrength to <hi>Praſſeram,</hi> whereby he obtain'd Victory over them. <hi>Praſſeram</hi> hereupon deſcending in great rage with his <hi>Perſy,</hi> Bowes and Arrows in his Hands, amongſt the Company of <hi>Ragia Siſtraerſim,</hi> defeated him and all his Guards; from thence going to all parts of the World, he ſlew all the <hi>Ketteries</hi> he could meet with, which ſtruck ſuch a terror into the reſt, that they forſook and deny'd their own Families and Sects; yet nevertheleſs <hi>Praſſeram</hi> could not find them all out, for in a few years after, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them getting together, rebell'd again, and forc'd him a ſecond time to War againſt them, whenas he ſuppos'd he had before ſlain them all; but as Weeds will ſtill ſpring up, ſo likewiſe this curſed Tribe was increas'd by thoſe who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny'd their Names, or hid themſelves, and thus forc'd <hi>Praſſeram</hi> to revenge himſelf twenty two ſeveral times, till at laſt he left not one of them alive. Moreover <hi>Mahadeu</hi> remembring that he had ask'd <hi>Praſſeram</hi>'s Parents three ſeveral times what they deſir'd, and they crav'd nothing but ſuch a fair Child as he himſelf then appear'd to them, therefore he reſolv'd to give them two ſuch Sons more as this <hi>Praſſeram</hi> was: wherefore he commanded the four-headed <hi>Bramma</hi> to ſend the Souls of <hi>Siamdichemi</hi> and <hi>Reneka</hi> into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Ragia Diſſerat</hi> and his Conſort <hi>Conſila,</hi> who were ſlain amongſt the <hi>Ketteries;</hi> for <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deu</hi> had promis'd to promote their Family. <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> hereupon looking into the Books of Secrets, and though he found the time of theſe People come to a period, yet to oblige <hi>Mahadeu,</hi> he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd his Command, and accordingly ſent the Soul of <hi>Siamdichemi</hi> into <hi>Ragia Diſſerat,</hi> and that of <hi>Reneka</hi> into <hi>Conſila;</hi> out of which Couple <hi>Ram</hi> was afterwards born, who when he was come to age, Marry'd a <hi>Sita;</hi> but as the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Benjans,</hi> were Riding about the City, <hi>Praſſeram</hi> met them, and asking the Spectators from what Family the Bridegroom proceeded, was anſwer'd, That his Name was <hi>Ram,</hi> and that he was of the Tribe of the <hi>Ketteries:</hi> Whereat <hi>Praſſeram</hi> being mightily enrag'd, ſaid, <hi>Are there yet more remaining of this Vermin? I will inſtantly deſtroy him, as I have done his Predeceſſors;</hi> and immediately drawing his Bowe to ſhoot <hi>Ram</hi> as he rode upon an Elephant, <hi>Ram</hi> ſeeing him aim at him, alſo drew his Bowe, and coming near one another, let flie their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which meeting together in the Air, all <hi>Praſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeram</hi>'s Power went into <hi>Ram</hi>'s Arrow, who by that means was bereav'd of all his Strength, inſomuch that he was afterwards no more than an ordinary <hi>Brahman.</hi>

               <p>This concluded the whole work of <hi>Ram</hi>'s Altar, and alſo the <hi>Tretangke,</hi> or ſecond Age, which had laſted one Million two hundred ſixty nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, of which <hi>Ram</hi> had Reign'd two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>
               <p>For the good Services done by the Apes to <hi>Ram</hi> in his time, they are held in great veneration by the <hi>Indians;</hi> and in the Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu, Cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and other Places, they ſet up ſeveral Figures of Apes in their <hi>Pagodes;</hi> and this is affirm'd by <hi>Linſchot,</hi> who ſaith, That in former Ages there was no greater, nor more precious a Relick in all <hi>India,</hi> than an Apes Tooth, which being tipt with Gold, and beſet with Precious Stones, was kept in a <hi>Pagode</hi> on the Mountain <hi>Piko d' Adam</hi> on the Iſland <hi>Ceilon;</hi> to which place the <hi>Indians</hi> went in Pilgrimage from all places thereabouts, nay, ſome came thither out of ſeveral Countreys lying four or five hundred Leagues from thence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> coming to this Iſland about the Year 1555. to aſſiſt the lawful King, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by a Rebel, they went up the foremention'd Mountain, where ruining the <hi>Pagode,</hi> they found nothing elſe but a ſmall Cabinet full of Precious Stones, and the Apes Tooth, all which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rry'd to <hi>Goa,</hi> which when the Kings of <hi>Ceilon, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala, Biſnagar,</hi> and others heard, they ſent Agents to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Vice-Roy at <hi>Goa,</hi> to requeſt the reſtauration of the Tooth, proffering as a Ranſom for the ſame (beſides many Preſents) a Sum of ſeven thouſand Ducats of Gold, which upon the perſwaſion of the Arch-biſhop was refus'd by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who burnt the Tooth, and threw the Aſhes into the Sea.</p>

The <hi>Ragia Kans,</hi> upon their recommendation ſending for him, gave him his Siſter in Marriage; and when ſhe had attain'd to the twelfth year of her age, and the <hi>Brahman</hi> to the nineteenth or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, the <hi>Chan,</hi> according to Cuſtom, ſhew'd them to all his Subjects; after which he commanded <hi>Denki,</hi> and a certain <hi>Brahman</hi> call'd <hi>Naret,</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd in the Art of Aſtrology, or rather Cheiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, and lately come into that Countrey, to come before him, requiring the ſaid <hi>Brahman</hi> to look in <hi>Denkies</hi> Hand, and to tell him whether ſhe ſhould be fortunate or unfortunate, rich or poor, have few or many Children, be ſhort or long liv'd, live joyfully or ſorrowfully, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honor ſhe ſhould attain to, and in ſhort, what would happen to her, ſtrictly charging him to declare the plain truth, without flattery or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. The <hi>Brahman</hi> looking into her Hand upon the Kings Command, and having view'd the ſame, beſpake him after this manner: <hi>My Lord and King, according as the Lines appear here, ſhe will be the Mother of ſeven Children,</hi> viz. <hi>ſix Sons and one Daughter, the laſt whereof will bereave you of your Life and Crown, and Reign in your ſtead.</hi> This Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication of being deſtroy'd by his own Blood, made the King exceeding ſorrowful, inſomuch that he commanded <hi>Denki</hi> to depart out of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as not worthy to ſee his Face; nay, he gave order to lock her and her Husband up in the Caſtle, and to ſet ſtrong Guards about the ſame, and commanded all the Midwives, that as ſoon as ever <hi>Denki</hi> was Deliver'd of a Child, it ſhould immediately be brought to him; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly perform'd: for no ſooner was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Denki</hi> Deliver'd, but the Infant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly carry'd to her Brother, who forthwith kill'd it: Thus he did ſix ſeveral times, <hi>viz.</hi> to five Sons and one Daughter; and when <hi>Denki</hi> had Conceiv'd the ſeventh time, and <hi>Kans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd thereof, he caus'd a ſtricter Guard to be kept upon her than before, locking her up in a Chamber with ſeven Iron Doors, and ſetting a hundred Soldiers to guard them, ſtrictly charging them, that as ſoon as they heard the Child cry, they ſhould give him notice thereof, that he might diſpoſe of it as he had done of the reſt. In the Moneth <hi>Sawanne,</hi> or <hi>Srawanam,</hi> which is our <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the Day <hi>Aerhem,</hi> being the eighth of the dark Moon, the time of her Delivery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, ſhe was exceedingly troubled, to think that this her laſt Child, of which ſhe expected to be Deliver'd, ſhould be ſo cruelly murder'd as all the former had been: Sitting thus melancholy, ſhe was on a ſudden, without pain, about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63517:109"/>deliver'd of a moſt beautiful Son, whoſe Face was reſplendent like the Moon in the Full, inſomuch that he enlightned the whole Room. At this <hi>Denki</hi> rejoyc'd exceedingly, and wondred not a little at her beautiful Son; but very much lamented to think what hard fortune was decreed him: But <hi>Mahadeu,</hi> who had inſpir'd this Child with his Divine Power, gave him alſo Speech, ſo that he comforted his ſorrowful Mother with theſe Words, <hi>viz. That ſhe ſhould reſt ſatisfied, and he would find means to eſcape his Uncles bloody Hands, and alſo deliver her from her Impriſonment.</hi> And turning to his Father, he ſaid, <hi>Come ſwathe me up, and carry me to</hi> Goggel, <hi>on the oppoſite Shore of the Stream</hi> Siemmena, <hi>into the Houſe of the</hi> Brahman Nen, <hi>whoſe Wife</hi> Jeſſouda <hi>is juſt deliver'd of a Daughter; change me for her, and leaving me there, bring the other Infant hither, and all things will be well.</hi> But the Father replying, ſaid, <hi>How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to carry you out of this cloſe Priſon, where not ſo much as the Wind can find any paſſage out or in? How then ſhall I be able to get through theſe Iron Gates, and great number of Centinels? Trouble not your ſelf</hi> (ſaid <hi>Kiſna,</hi> for that was the Name given the Infant by his Father) <hi>about effecting what I have deſir'd; for the Doors will fly open, and the Watchmen all fall aſleep, ſo that none ſhall diſcover you.</hi> Which the Infant had no ſooner ſaid, but the Locks and Bolts flew open, and <hi>Waſſendeu</hi> taking the Child in his Arms, walk'd by the Watches, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen by any of them: But coming to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Siemmena,</hi> oppoſite to the City <hi>Goggel,</hi> he was much troubled to ſee the Water extraordinary high, and run down with great violence; till <hi>Kiſna</hi> commanding the River to open a way in the midſt for his Father, the Water immediately divided it ſelf, and ſtood firm on each ſide, like Walls, until they were paſt over. Being come to the Houſe of the holy <hi>Brahman Nen,</hi> the Door where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of opened of it ſelf, <hi>Waſſendeu</hi> entred boldly with his Son, and found the <hi>Brahman Nen</hi> with his Wife in a ſound ſleep; and they not hearing him, he chang'd <hi>Kiſna</hi> his Son for the new-born Maid, with whom he return'd to the Priſon, the Stream <hi>Siemmena</hi> opening a Path for him, as before. When he was come to the Gates, he found them open, and the Watch ſtill aſleep; but no ſooner was he entred one Gate, but the ſame ſhut after him, and ſo likewiſe all the ſeven. Being come into the Priſon, he deliver'd the Child to his Wife; but the Watch awaking, and quickly hearing it cry, they entred the Chamber where theſe two unfortunate Lovers were lock'd up, and taking the Child from them, carried it to <hi>Ragia Cans,</hi> who ſeeing that it was a Maid, ſaid, <hi>What did this fooliſh</hi> Brahman Narret <hi>Prognoſticate? He was mad, and did not know the truth of the buſineſs. Cans</hi> nevertheleſs, for fear ſhe might hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of his Life, reſolv'd to murther her; but taking the Infant by its Legs, intending to ſtrike it againſt the Wall, it ſlipp'd out of his Hands, and ſtarting up, ſaid, <hi>O moſt inhumane Blood-hound! What do you ſeek to murder me for? I am not the right Party; but he that ſhall bereave you of Life, Crown, and Realm, and revenge the death of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſter ſo inhumanely butcher'd by you, is alive and well in the City</hi> Goggel. Which ſaid, the Child flew into the Air, where <hi>Mahadeu</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it into Lightning, which was never ſeen before that time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ragia Cans</hi> exceedingly amaz'd hereat, and calling all his Council, ask'd what this Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might portend. They all told him, that ſome great Event would ſuddenly follow; yet none knew certainly what the iſſue thereof would be, which made him ſorrowful and perplex'd in mind. Mean while being inform'd, That in <hi>Goggel</hi> was a moſt beautiful Youth, kept by the Pious <hi>Brahman Nen,</hi> he fear'd that he might be the Revenger of the Infants death which he had murder'd, as the Maid had told him; therefore he ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd how this Youth might alſo be deſtroy'd, which by force he durſt not attempt, fearing that all his Subjects would oppoſe him, and the rather, becauſe of the Piety of the <hi>Brahman:</hi> But at laſt he invented the following means: <hi>viz.</hi> He call'd his eldeſt Siſter <hi>Poetena,</hi> ſaying; Poetena, <hi>if at once you love me, your own Life, and will preſerve my Realm and Crown, then do me this kindneſs;</hi> viz. <hi>Take Preſents with you, and go to the Houſe of the Pious</hi> Brahman Nen, <hi>whoſe Wife hath lately been deliver'd of a Son, whom I deſire you by ſome means or other to let ſuck out of your Breaſt, which you muſt firſt annoint with the moſt powerful Poyſon that can be had, that by that means when the Child comes to ſuck you it may be kill'd.</hi> Which ſhe promiſing to do, was ſent with many rich Preſents to <hi>Goggel,</hi> where ſo ſoon as ſhe was arriv'd ſhe went to the Houſe of <hi>Nen,</hi> whoſe Wife ſhe wiſh'd much Joy with her young Son, giving her great Preſents, thereby to be the leſs miſtruſted, and cover her falſe deſign; and deſir'd to have the Child lie in her Lap, which being given her, and ſhe looking upon it, ſaid, <hi>Indeed the Reports which go of this Youth in</hi> Mottera <hi>are no ways falſe; for I never ſaw a more beautiful Babe in my whole life: I do not repent my trouble of coming hither.</hi> Thus <hi>Poetena</hi> flattering the Babe, ſometimes kiſs'd it, and danc'd it up and down, the better to hide her wicked intent. At laſt opening her poyſonous Boſom, ſhe laid the Infant <hi>Kiſna</hi> to the ſame, hoping that it would there breathe its laſt; but the Child ſtrengthned by, <hi>Mahadeu</hi>'s Power againſt all Poyſons, taking the Nipple into its Mouth, not onely ſuck'd away all her Milk, but the Blood out of her Veins, and alſo her Soul; and by that means immediately growing cold and ſtiff, ſhe fell down dead: Which when King <hi>Cans</hi> heard, he grew exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, practiſing divers ways to deſtroy the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Kiſna,</hi> but all in vain; for, growing up in years, he for a time became a Herdſman, and under that form wrought many ſtrange Miracles, too tedious to inſert: And, amongſt others, when the laſt Hour of his Altar was come, he went out of <hi>Dowarca,</hi> and taking up a handful of Dirt, threw the ſame over the City, by which means all the Golden Roofs, Streets, and ſtately Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, became nothing but Hay, Clay, Wood, and Stones. Imediately after which, <hi>Kiſna</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the World, aſcended to Heaven, ſo end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Altar, which had laſted only a hundred Years, in the third Age call'd <hi>Duaperſing,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 864000 Years.</p>

               <p>Though the <hi>Pagodes</hi> of <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> and <hi>Eſwara</hi> are of a conſiderable bigneſs, being much larger than thoſe of the leſſer <hi>Numens,</hi> yet are they not comparable to the Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> being very low and flat; yet ſome of them have high Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as amongſt others the <hi>Pagode</hi> near <hi>Tegnepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>The White Pagode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many places the <hi>Pagodes</hi> are built in the Fields, and are without Windows or Holes, ſo that no Light comes into them but through the Doors, ſo that they are generally very dark; they are commonly divided into three Walks, the firſt being a Vault reſting on Stone Columns, into which any one may come, it being always open: In it are ſeveral Statues of Elephants, Oxen, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are us'd in the Service of the Idol, who is often drawn upon them through the Streets of the Cities. The ſecond having a ſtrong Gate, is open onely in the day-time; but the <hi>Brahmans,</hi> who inhabit the ſame, ſuffer none to come in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is generally furniſh'd with Images of horrid Shapes as Men with many Heads and Arms. In the third Iſle, which is lock'd up with a ſtrong Door, ſtand the Images of <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> and <hi>Eſwara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They repreſent their God <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> or <hi>Mahadeu</hi> (according to <hi>Della Valle</hi>) in the likeneſs of a ſmall Stone Column, which grows leſs and leſs from the bottom upwards. The Name <hi>Mahadeu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> ſignifies properly <hi>Great God,</hi> whoſe Vertues they highly extol, believing him to be very wonderful, adding moreover, that whil'ſt he liv'd on Earth, he daily grew bigger and bigger, nay, that his Image ſtill grows greater as it ſtands in their Temples.</p>
               <p>They alſo repreſent <hi>Mahadeu</hi> in another Shape, of Cryſtal, and make Offerings at his Fet, which conſiſt in Milk, Oyl, Rice, and the like. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo repreſent him like a Man, but having ſixteen Arms on each ſide.</p>
               <p>Round about the <hi>Pagodes</hi> is a large inclos'd Plain full of ſmaller Buildings, ſerving for their leſſer Deities.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Pagode</hi> of <hi>Wiſtnow, Laetſemi,</hi> Conſort to <hi>Wiſtnow,</hi> hath a Chappel; as alſo <hi>Garrouda</hi> and <hi>Annemonta,</hi> both faithful Servants of <hi>Wiſtnow.</hi> The Image <hi>Garronda</hi> is repreſented like a Man, with Wings; that of <hi>Annemonta</hi> or <hi>Hanneman,</hi> with a Face like an Ape.</p>
               <p>On the foremention'd Plains ſtand Ciſterns, in which grows the Herb <hi>Toleje,</hi> which with its uſe is mention'd before. They never go on theſe Plains about the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> but always with their right Side towards the Temple.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> account their <hi>Pagodes</hi> to be the Houſes and Reſidences of their Gods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enter into them with great Reverence. Part of the Cuſtoms for Goods ſold and bought, are beſtow'd on them; as alſo part of the <hi>Sandal</hi> Wood, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and long Pepper, and likewiſe of all Monies that are Coin'd. They alſo go in Pilgrimage to the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and upon certain Feaſt-days make great Preſents and Offerings to them.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By means of the great concourſe to this <hi>Pagode</hi> it hath great advantages, amounting to a vaſt: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which ariſes wholly from the Preſents brought thither, none of the <hi>Heathens</hi> going with empty Hands, but diſcharging their Promiſes and Vows there, which they make for the obtaining of Health, or accompliſhing any Buſineſs.</p>

               <p>It is alſo a Cuſtom in this Countrey, to devote young Virgins to the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> after which they are bound never to Marry, but ſpend their Lives onely in Dancing before their Gods, to whom (as they ſay) it is ſo acceptable, that they ſhall merit Heaven by it.</p>

But their God <hi>Eſwara,</hi> they affirm, delights in ſomething elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to be waſh'd conſtantly with ſweet Waters, which his Worſhippers are no way negligent in performing, but continually waſh the aforeſaid Deity with all ſorts of perfum'd Waters.</p>
               <p>They alſo carry theſe Images every year on their Feſtival days through the moſt eminent Streets of their Cities, in a Wagon as high and large as an ordinary Houſe; thoſe which draw it are Fiſhermen, and the like mean People, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by a a great number of divers Tribes, which is a Cuſtom obſerv'd through the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

Towards the Evening they carry the Image home again through the Streets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with abundance of People carrying lighted Torches, and at laſt ſet it in the old place. The following day they ſhew honor to the God <hi>Eſwara,</hi> by carrying of his Image into the Fields after the ſame manner, as alſo on the twelfth, though not on Horſeback, but onely on Mens Shoulders.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Many things they relate of theſe Places, <hi>viz.</hi> That all thoſe which die in the <hi>Caſi,</hi> ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aſcend to Heaven, whether Man or Beaſt, but thoſe that die in any other of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Places, ſhall go to <hi>Bramma,</hi> and there having ſtay'd a conſiderable time, ſhall return into the World again, to be tranſmigrated into one or other Body; but if they have liv'd out their time, and have dy'd twice, then they ſhall go directly to Heaven, and not return again into this World.</p>
               <p>They affirm, that it is ſufficient for the Vulgar to die onely in the holy Places, from whence they undoubtedly go to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe Places have each their Limits, but are not of an equal bigneſs: for that of <hi>Caſi</hi> is but a Mile; that of <hi>Ayot-ja,</hi> twelve Leagues; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they account it a happineſs to die in one of them, yet none are allow'd, out of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire of Salvation, to bereave themſelves of life there, except at <hi>Preyaga,</hi> of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. As to what concerns theſe Places in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, they are deſcrib'd after this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ayot-ja,</hi> lying twelve Leagues Northward from <hi>Caſi,</hi> was the Birth-place of <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> under the Name of <hi>Ram.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Matura</hi> near <hi>Agra,</hi> the <hi>Great Mogol</hi>'s Court, <hi>Wiſtnow</hi> came into the World by the Name of <hi>Criſtna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſi,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Waranaſi,</hi> lying in <hi>Bengala</hi> near the Kiver <hi>Ganges,</hi> twelve Leagues from <hi>Ayot-ja,</hi> and twelve from <hi>Preyaga,</hi> is ſituate twelve Leagues higher up the <hi>Ganges</hi> then <hi>Caſi,</hi> and nearer to the City <hi>Agra,</hi> where three Branches of the <hi>Ganges</hi> uniting, are accounted ſo holy, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> believe thoſe which die in this Water to be certainly purg'd from their ſins; and therefore this Place is very famous amongſt them, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is no wonder, becauſe (as they ſay) all thoſe which die there are happy.</p>
               <p>The City <hi>Canje,</hi> or <hi>Cansjewaram,</hi> a great and well known City in the Kingdom of <hi>Carnatica,</hi> hath many <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and is therefore accounted very holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Awentecapouri,</hi> or <hi>Awenteutica,</hi> is a City lying Northward from <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dwaraka</hi> or <hi>Dwaraweti,</hi> formerly lay near <hi>Zur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratte,</hi> but is ſaid to have been waſh'd away by the Sea. In this Place they relate that <hi>Criſtna</hi> dy'd, and that his Body when (according to the Cuſtom of the Countrey) it was going to be burnt, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo waſh'd away by the Sea, and driven to <hi>Sjanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata</hi> or <hi>Prouſotamai,</hi> a Place near <hi>Bengala;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they account the Pagode <hi>Sjangernata</hi> to be very holy.</p>
               <p>The viſiting of theſe holy Places extends not onely to the forgiveneſs of ſins, but they alſo aſcribe ſo great a power thereto, that by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of them onely they believe they ſhall obtain pardon; wherefore Perſons of Quality that are religious read over the Names of them every Morning; therefore thoſe that cannot go to <hi>Caſi</hi> and other holy Places, content themſelves onely with the bare naming of them.</p>
               <p>They hold that the keeping of their Feaſts, and waſhing their Bodies with ſalt Water, alſo merits remiſſion of ſins; alſo they go in Pilgrimage to the Pagode <hi>Rammeſwara,</hi> by the <hi>Malabars</hi> call'd <hi>Rammanatakovil,</hi> partly for the great Sanctity of the Place, and partly becauſe the Sea-water that flows by this <hi>Pagode,</hi> is always clear, and fit to waſh in.</p>
               <p>The like opinion they have of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and therefore the Inhabitants of <hi>Bengala</hi> which dwell about it, have a Cuſtom to bring all dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thither, and put one half of their Bodies into it to waſh away their ſins. But all Perſons are not permitted to waſh themſelves therein without paying Tribute to thoſe Kings through whoſe Countreys the River runs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brahmans</hi> derive the Sanctity of this River from Heaven, and confirm their Fancy with many ridiculous Fables, yet they firmly believe the ſame, becauſe their <hi>Vedam</hi> or Law-book doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</p>
               <p>All the foremention'd ways the <hi>Heathens</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to obtain remiſſion of their ſins; and if any chance not to have endeavor'd the ſame, yet they believe, that their Friends or Relations which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive may do ſomething for their benefit after Death; particularly, they carry and throw the Bones of the Deceaſed into the holy River <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which they firmly believe will turn much to the Deceaſed's advantage, who for every year that their Bones lie in the ſaid River, they ſhall enjoy a thouſand years of pleaſure in <hi>Dewendre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirty Leagues Southward from <hi>Caſi</hi> lies a City call'd <hi>Goya,</hi> where it is ſaid, that God ſetting his Foot on a great Stone, left the print thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, which is yet to be ſeen. Round about this City is a Fort for the preſervation of the foremention'd Relick.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that go in Pilgrimage to <hi>Preyaga,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpend a whole month there, and waſh themſelves daily before the Sun riſes in the River <hi>Ganges;</hi> after the expiration of which they go from thence to <hi>Caſi,</hi> where alſo they ſpend a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, they come again to <hi>Gaga,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Paſte of fine Flour, they lay ſeveral pieces thereof on the foremention'd Stone, naming at the laying down of each piece one of their deceaſed Friends, who (as their <hi>Vedam</hi> or Law-book affirms)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63517:116"/>are deliver'd out of <hi>Jamma Locon,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to the place of <hi>Dewendre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They maintain that the Wicked ſhall meet with more or leſs puniſhment after this Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, and that ſome after Death are puniſh'd in this World, and others in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>They alſo believe, that the Souls of ſome when they die, tranſmigrate into other Bodies. Amongſt thoſe whoſe Souls are tranſmigrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bodies of Beaſts, they account thoſe which enter into a Cow the moſt happy, becauſe of all Beaſts that is moſt acceptable to their God.</p>
               <p>Some they believe are for their ſins, condemn'd to be evil Spirits, flying up and down in the Air, till the time of their puniſhment be expir'd.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are not puniſh'd in the World, are tortur'd in <hi>Jamma,</hi> or Hell, though ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd after the expiration of many years, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming again into this World, enter into one or other Body; yet ſome never return from thence, but are for ever puniſh'd there, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are put into the <hi>Antam Tappes,</hi> that is, <hi>The Pit of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> out of which none can come, but muſt remain there for ever, and undergo perpetual torments, the place being full of Thiſtles and Thorns, Crows with Iron Bills, devouring Dogs, ſtinging Worms, and all things elſe to make them miſerable.</p>
               <p>Moreover they affirm, that there are five deadly Sins never to be forgiven, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To commit Inceſt with their Mother, (by the word Mother they not onely underſtand their natural Mother, but alſo their Mother-in-law, and the Wife of their Maſters or Tutors.) 2. To kill a <hi>Brahman.</hi> 3. To ſteal Gold. 4. To be a Drunkard; and 5. To converſe with them.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the condition of thoſe that are eſteem'd happy after Death, they give this Account: That ſome of them return again to the World, after the expiration of a certain limited time; though others attain a perpetual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs at the firſt; That ſuch as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to come a ſecond time into the World, have ſeven places appointed for them, <hi>viz. Indre-Locon</hi> or <hi>Dewendre-Lokon, Agni-Locon, Niruti-Locon, Wajoiva-Locon, Cubera-Locon, Iſanja-Locon,</hi> and <hi>Waſrouna-Locon,</hi> all of them ſo call'd from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which Govern them. Thoſe which come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Places, enjoy ſo much happineſs in them, that they wiſh for no greater, and every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts his own Place the beſt. But beſides theſe ſeven, which are call'd by the general Name of <hi>Dewendre-Locon</hi> or <hi>Surgam,</hi> there is another call'd <hi>Bramma-Locon,</hi> the place where <hi>Bramma</hi> reſides, and is the neareſt Heaven: Thoſe which go thither after Death, muſt after the expiration of ſome years return again into the World, where having ſtay'd their appointed time, they certainly go to Heaven, for ever to enjoy all manner of Delights and Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that inhabit the <hi>Surgam</hi> they name <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weta's,</hi> which are of two ſorts; ſome ſtaying there onely for a time, return again into the World, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they enjoy all manner of Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Other <hi>Deweta's</hi> ſtay for ever in the <hi>Surgam,</hi> as alſo the Sun, Moon, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They alſo beget Children in the <hi>Surgam,</hi> where they affirm no ſins are committed, becauſe God himſelf appearing therein, inſtructs them. Moreover, the happieſt that depart from hence, are thoſe which attain to the <hi>Weicontam,</hi> which is Heaven it ſelf: But the <hi>Brahmans</hi> make mention of two <hi>Weicontams,</hi> a <hi>Lila-Weicontam,</hi> that is, <hi>The Delightful Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>Singel-Weicontam,</hi> where God himſelf hath his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence.</p>

Yet although theſe <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have the <hi>Alcoran</hi> like the <hi>Turks,</hi> and uſe it, yet they differ in many-things: for the <hi>Turks</hi> onely worſhip God and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but the <hi>Indian Mahumetans</hi> reverence alſo <hi>Aaly</hi> and his Son <hi>Haſſan,</hi> but chiefly <hi>Haſſan,</hi> whom they account their chiefeſt Mediator; yet they agree in all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonies of Marriage, Burying, Eating, and Praying, with the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians:</hi> They alſo go without Shoes into their <hi>Metzids</hi> or Temples, where, when many of them are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſtand in Rows with their Faces towards the South, whil'ſt the <hi>Molla</hi> or Prieſt ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, fixes his Eyes on a place in the Walk which hath an Inſcription upon it, and ſhakes both his Arms up and down like a Bird that is going to flie, which all die Congregation imitate in ſilence; after which the Prieſt and People falling down on their Knees, bow their Heads down to the Ground, which ſome kiſs, and ſtanding up again, perform the ſame five ſeveral times together; which done, they ſalute God and their Prophet <hi>Haſſan</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Sſalom Alecum;</hi> then they Pray aloud after the <hi>Molla;</hi> after which ſome go away again, and others ſtaying in the Temple, diſcourſe one with another about worldly Affairs, as if on an Exchange, and alſo take Tobacco in the ſame; to which purpoſe many carry a Steel, Flint, and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with Pipes and Tobacco at their Girdle. Amongſt them are commonly two or three Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who carry Raiſins, a Steel Mirror, and a Copper Baſon about with them, proffering their Service. Many alſo as ſoon as their Service is done in the Temple, go immediately after to the publick Stews, maintaining nevertheleſs that they are faithful Servants to God and their Prophet.</p>
               <p>Some to be reputed zealous, Pray on the Roofs of their Houſes.</p>
               <p>No Women are permitted to go to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but are kept lock'd up in their Houſes, ſo that they neither know nor hear any thing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more than what their Husbands acquaint them with.</p>
               <p>They Circumciſe their Children not before the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63517:116"/>eighth year, wherein they differ alſo from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> who do it in the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth years.</p>
               <p>They Pray five times every day like the <hi>Turks, viz.</hi> firſt, two hours before the Sun riſes; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about noon; thirdly, at four of the clock in the afternoon; fourthly, about ſix; and fifthly, at nine; at all which times they are ſummon'd thereto by a kind of Sexton, who cries aloud from the Steeple of their Temples. But for what reaſon they Pray thus often, they give this ridiculous Tale, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Creation God created <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Light in the ſhape of a Peacock; which Light God afterwards put into a great white Pearl, hanging it on a Tree, whereby the Creator was magnifi'd above a thouſand years; after which God made a Glaſs of life, and ſet before <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Peacock, who when he ſaw his curious ſhape, worſhipp'd God five times; from whence it comes to paſs that the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> Pray five times aday; but the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> Pray onely three times.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe <hi>Haſſaniſts</hi> are alſo a ſort of Monks, who by the <hi>Arabians</hi> are call'd <hi>Derwis,</hi> and by the <hi>Perſians, Abdalles;</hi> they agree with thoſe by the <hi>Heathen Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Jogues</hi> or <hi>Jogiis.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Order of the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Haſſaniſts</hi>
                  </note>Theſe <hi>Derwiſes</hi> range up and down through Towns and Countreys, having no ſetled Reſidence in any place, but ſleep whereſoever they go in the <hi>Metzids,</hi> their Bed being onely a Sheep-skin, which in ſtead of an upper Garment they wear on their Backs. They are of ſeveral Orders, each bearing the Name of their chief Saint, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as amongſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> No Perſon of whom they Beg, may turn them away without giving them ſomething. They are for the moſt part inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and well learn'd in their Books. They ſtand oftentimes in the Market-places, where calling the People about them, they extol their own Religion, and deſpiſe that of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> Some of them ſcruple not to affirm, that by <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi>'s means (ſo much intereſt they are perſwaded he hath with God) the Devil may obtain mercy, but not the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they believe not in <hi>Haſſein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any Man may enter into this Order, as thoſe that cannot live by their Trades commonly do, and under that Name commit all manner of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies: yet ſome of them voluntarily undergo very great hardſhips, either living like Hermits on the tops of Mountains overgrown with Trees and Brambles, and remote from all People, where they ſpend their Lives, without ever ſtirring from the place where they once ſeat themſelves, except it be to be to disburden Nature, continually ſaying theſe or the like words, <hi>I affect You and not the World, I do all this for Your ſake, therefore look upon me, O Almighty God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe People that betake themſelves to this kind of Living, never ſhave themſelves, nor pair their Nails, but let them grow like Claws; they will rather endure hunger, than go out of their Huts; wherefore thoſe that know their Abodes, out of compaſſion will ſend them Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which muſt be of the meaneſt, or elſe they will not eat it, and no more than they can eat at once. Some take up a reſolution to Faſt a certain number of days, and will eat no kind of Meat du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, till they have in a manner quite ſtarv'd themſelves. Others go ſtark naked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Cloth before their Privities, and beg for their Food.</p>
               <p>Theſe People by ſome ſtrange means or other, prognoſticate wonderful things, which makes the Vulgar flock about them, and hearken with great earneſtneſs to what they ſay. There are ſome ſome amongſt them call'd <hi>Mandees,</hi> who as a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their ſins cut and ſlaſh their Bodies; and others wear ſuch Chains about their Legs, that they are ſcarce able to ſtir, going bare-foot on the hot Ground with blue Cloaks about them in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, to the Burying-places of their Saints.</p>
               <p>There are alſo a ſort of <hi>Jogues</hi> amongſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> who (according to <hi>Texeira</hi>) are call'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendares,</hi> that travel to colder and more populous Countreys, eſpecially through <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> and therefore taking greater care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than the other <hi>Jogues,</hi> cover their Bodies with Sheep-skins, and alſo make Stockings and Shoes of them. They alſo act the parts of Juglers, carrying a green Purſe, with Flowers or the like, in their Hands, which proffering to thoſe they meet with, they read ſome <hi>Arabian</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them, by that means to get ſome Alms.</p>

                  </note>The <hi>Haſſaniſts</hi> eat onely once a day, <hi>viz.</hi> about three a clock in the afternoon, not ſitting on Stools at high Tables like us, but the Floor, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Carpet, ſerves them not onely for Stools, but a Table alſo, ſitting on the ſame with their Legs under them; being thus ſeated, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at Feaſts, a Servant comes with a Baſon and Ewer, and going from one to another, pours out the Water for them to waſh their Hands; after which the Meat is brought in Copper Diſhes, Tinn'd in the inſide, and about three yards in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; they are commonly fill'd with Rice, boyl'd with Butter, Fleſh, Onions, Garlick, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Almonds, Raiſins, and the like: They often colour their Rice green, yellow, brown, blue, and red, according to the <hi>Perſian</hi> way: After the Meat is ſet before them, they fall to eating thereof, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Prayer but this, <hi>In the Name of God, gracious and merciful,</hi> which words ſtand before eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chapter in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> They have no Bread, there growing onely a little Wheat, and no Rye in all the Countrey, and therefore eat ſcalded Rice in ſtead of Bread. Their Trenchers are Cakes bak'd thin, which many after they have Din'd alſo eat, or put them up in their Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
               <p>Their common Drink is Water, which they drink not till after their Meals, when it is brought to every one by a Servant, in a Copper Cup; they never drink ſtanding, but always ſitting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it very unwholſom to do the contrary.</p>
               <p>After Meals they have again warm Water brought them to waſh their Hands; which done, ſome riſe up, and go away without ſpeaking a word, or returning thanks to the Maſter of the Feaſt; others, eſpecially if they are Friends or intimate Acquaintance, ſtay and ſmoak a Pipe of Tobacco and drink a Diſh of Coffee.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Haſſaniſts</hi> are temperate at Meals, yet moſt of them are inclin'd to Drinking in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and commonly in the Night, that they may not be diſcover'd; for to be Drunk is accounted an abomination amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The beſt Liquor which Perſons of Quality drink, is <hi>Perſian</hi> Wine; they alſo drink Spirits, diſtill'd out of Dates and Sugar; alſo Palm-Wine, call'd <hi>Terri</hi> or <hi>Tori,</hi> which they drink when freſh tapt out of the Palm-trees.</p>

               <p>One of the King's Eunuchs, an intimate Friend to one of theſe <hi>Chans,</hi> being aſſur'd that they were neceſſitated, for want of Proviſions and Supplies, to ſurrender the Fort, deliver'd a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtain their Pardon from the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> who was ſo inrag'd thereat, that he immediately caus'd the Eunuch's Head to be cut off, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allow'd to intercede for thoſe with whom the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> is diſpleas'd.</p>
               <p>The Skins of the foremention'd <hi>Chans,</hi> being ſtuff'd, were hung on a high Pole erected near the <hi>Maidan,</hi> and their Fleſh thrown to the Dogs: Soon after which, the King caus'd their Wives and Children to be Beheaded, and ſent out Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to kill their Relations which dwelt up and down in the Countrey; which was accordingly perform'd, and their Heads brought before the King.</p>

               <p>THe Ancient Seat of the <hi>Mogol</hi> Kings was at <hi>Deli;</hi> but King <hi>Ecbar</hi> remov'd his Court to <hi>Agra,</hi> and (by reaſon of the loſs of his two Sons there, built another Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Palace, and call'd the ſame <hi>Pateful,</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefur.</hi> Since the Conquering of the Kingdom of <hi>Lahor,</hi> the Metropolis thereof being of the ſame denomination with the Kingdom, was choſe to be the Royal Seat of the Kings. <hi>Texeira</hi> tells us, That the King ſpends one part of the Year in the City <hi>Lahor,</hi> and the other in <hi>Agra,</hi> the two emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt Cities of the Kingdom, and in the Heart of <hi>Indoſtan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others affirm, That the City <hi>Agra</hi> is the Chief Reſidence of the King in the Winter; beſides which, he hath ſeveral other Towns and Fortreſſes wherein he reſides in the Summer Seaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> from the latter end of <hi>March</hi> till the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Gaſmir,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Cabul,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>Mandoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King's Houſes are generally built of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or white Alabaſter, and the Wall's inlaid with Gold.</p>

On that ſide which is towards the City it hath a Gate or Entrance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is a ſpacious Quadrangular Plain, on which the moſt eminent Traders keep their Shops. On each ſide of the Gate is a huge Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant cut in Stone, where ſtand ſeveral Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.</p>
               <p>About half a Mile inwards from the Gate, you come to the <hi>Namchas,</hi> or the Court where the King appears daily to his Subjects, which being a large Place, is built round with Lodgings for the <hi>Amurouwen</hi> or Nobles, who ſtay in them till the King comes to his Throne, when every one of them muſt appear before him, ſtanding in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places.</p>
               <p>The King's Throne is firſt encompaſs'd with a large Wooden Rail, within which ſtand all the Servants with Wooden Clubs; and within this Rail is another of Silver, about which ſtand the Kings Guards clad in red Cloth embroyder'd with Gold, and Arm'd with Swords, Shields, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Truncheons.

In the midſt of the Square ſtands the Throne, rais'd about a Mans height from the Ground, and is of maſſy Gold, emboſs'd with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, and richly enamell'd.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the Kings Attendance at Court, it is very Magnificent, and exceeds all the other Eaſtern Princes.

               <p>In <hi>Zurratte</hi> and ſeveral other Places in <hi>India,</hi> and moſt part of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Countrey, they travel in a pretty ſort of Chariots with two Wheels, the bottoms whereof are ſquare, and rais'd very high from the Ground above the Wheels; there are no Seats in the ſame, but they ſit on the Floor after the Eaſtern manner, with their Legs acroſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; both before and behind are Cuſhions to lean againſt. Theſe Chariots are very like thoſe us'd by the ancient <hi>Indians,</hi> and mention'd by <hi>Strabo;</hi> they are for the moſt part us'd in the Plain-Countrey, to travel withal from one Town to another, and alſo to ride abroad in for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they being very light and eaſie: When they come to a bad Way or Hills, they take out their Oxen and the Wheels from the Chariot, which alſo, if occaſion require, may be taken in two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with eaſe carry'd by two Men on the top of a Mountain or Hill, and put together again when they are paſt the troubleſom Way. After our manner of ſitting, two would ſcarce be able to ſit in one of theſe Chariots, but after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner, four with eaſe. They are drawn by Oxen in ſtead of Horſes, two to each Chariot, generally faſtned to the Axletree, which is made like a Yoke. Theſe Oxen are of a curious ſhape and colour; the beſt are generally white, and ſome ſpeckled black; they are very ſlender, and have on their Shoulders towards their Necks, a Bunch like the Camels; they trot and gallop as faſt as Horſes, and are able to travel thirty five or thirty ſix Miles in a day; they are guided by a Cord, run through Holes made in their Noſes, and are as eaſie to be commanded therewith as Horſes.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In like manner the Chariots are neatly adorn'd with the like crimſon Cloth, or elſe with Velvet.</p>
               <p>When any Women ride in theſe Chariots, they ſhut them cloſe round about to keep them from being ſeen.</p>
               <p>Perſons of Quality, who are allow'd to uſe Elephants, travel on them in little Towers, which are like Bedſteads, hung round with Cloth of Gold and Silk; they ſtand longways croſs the Beaſt, and are ſo long, that a Man may eaſily lie at his full length in them; but the breadth is ſuch, that two can but juſt lie together ſide by ſide.</p>
               <p>They alſo uſe theſe kind of Towers on Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants in the Wars, placing nine or ten Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers or Bowemen in them, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Countrey: He that guides the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hant ſits ſtradling upon his Neck, and governs him not with a Bridle, but with a ſharp Iron Hook, with which he pricks his Ears, Mouth, or any other part.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Palakins,</hi> being like little Beds cover'd with Cloth, are carry'd by four or ſix Men, with a great Cane, which reaching from one end to the other, lies on their Shoulders: Theſe Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers go not on the ſides, but two before and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. This way of being carry'd is very eaſie and common in <hi>India,</hi> inſomuch that all <hi>Europeans,</hi> when they travel, are carry'd after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Muſick</note>The common Muſick of the <hi>Indians</hi> is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, conſiſting onely in making of a ſtrange noiſe. But they have amongſt them an Inſtrument not altogether unharmonious, which is made of two black varniſh'd Globes of Wood, with Holes through for the ſound to paſs through. Theſe two Globles are faſtned to both ends of a little Board about three ſpans long, on which are ſtrung ſeveral Braſs or Copper Wyres, which are ſupported in as many places as there are Notes in the Tune which they intend to play. The Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian playing with his right Hand, takes away the Supporters of the Strings with his left when he pleaſes to alter the Notes, though not with his Fingers, but with certain Iron Wyres made faſt to little Rings, which he moves on the ends of his Fingers, with which ſtriking gently on the Strings, he makes a pleaſant noiſe. For the more eaſe in playing, the Muſician hangs this Inſtrument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck, and holds it before him like a Lute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> alſo have Flutes, ſo big, that an Elephant carrying one on each ſide, and an <hi>Indian</hi> in the middle, hath a ſufficient Load. They have alſo Trumpets of a vaſt bigneſs.</p>

Nor ended the buſineſs ſo; for <hi>Choſrou</hi> was bereav'd of his Liberty, not being permitted to converſe with the People as before, but was committed, though after an Honorable manner, to the Cuſtody of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Noblemen, his Father likewiſe cauſing his Eye-lids to be ſew'd up, that ſo he might bereave him of his Sight without putting out his Eyes, and at once deprive him of the means to make any further trouble in the Kingdom: But after the expiration of ſome days, <hi>Selim</hi> cauſing his Eyes to be open'd again, prevented <hi>Choſrou</hi> from being always blind; yet though he beheld the Light of the Sun again, he enjoy'd not his Liberty, but was kept a cloſe Priſoner for the ſpace of two Years, not being allow'd, according to the King's Command, to have above one Man to wait upon him.</p>

               <p>But for the better explanation of this Story con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the foremention'd four Princes, and the <hi>Mogol Schach Jehan,</hi> we muſt relate what hapned a little before theſe Troubles between <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> and his Viſier <hi>Emir Jemla,</hi> becauſe this will declare the Nature and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> who afterwards came to be the <hi>Mogol</hi> and King of <hi>India.</hi> Hereby alſo it will appear after what manner <hi>Emir Jemla</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to lay the firſt Foundation of <hi>Oranchzef</hi> his Royalty.</p>
               <p>At the time of <hi>Oranchzef</hi>'s reſiding in <hi>Decan,</hi> the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> kept the foremention'd <hi>Emir Jemla</hi> as his Vice-Roy, and General of all his Forces. He being a <hi>Perſian</hi> born, and very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in <hi>India,</hi> was of no high Extract, yet a Man fit to undertake any Deſign, being a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and of a noble Spirit. He had amaſs'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Riches, not onely by his careful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of State Affairs, but by the Trade of thoſe Ships which he ſent to divers Coaſts, as alſo
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63517:131"/>by the Diamond Mines, which he alone Farm'd under borrow'd Names, keeping always many Men at work in them, inſomuch that that the whole Countrey talk'd of him and his abundance of Diamonds, which were not reckon'd but by Bags full. He alſo rendred himſelf very famous and powerful, by keeping ſeveral Troops of very choice Men beſides the King's Army, at his own proper Charge; and had alſo very good Artillery; which was manag'd and look'd after by <hi>Franks</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In ſhort, he was rich and potent, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after he had found out a means to get into the Kingdom of <hi>Carnate,</hi> and pillag'd all the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Temples in that Countrey, that the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> beginning to grow jealous of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to do him a great Diſcourteſie, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he was not able to bear what he heard of him, for it was reported as if he had been too familiar with the Queen his Mother, who was very beautiful: Yet nevertheleſs he made no Perſon privy to his Deſign, but waited with patience till <hi>Emir Jemla</hi> ſhould come to the Court, he being at that time with his Army in <hi>Carnate.</hi> But not long after, when he was told of ſeveral other Paſſages that had hapned between his Mother and him, he was not able to contain his Paſſion, but flew out into many threatning Invectives, which quickly came to <hi>Emir</hi>'s Ears, he having many of his Wives Relations at the Court, who inform'd him thereof; and the King's Mother, who no ways hated him, was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd thereof, who oblig'd <hi>Emir</hi> with all ſpeed to write to his Son <hi>Mahomet Emurcan,</hi> he being then at the Court, giving him order upon ſight of his Letter, under pretence of going a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, immediately to come away to him. <hi>Emurcan</hi> neglected not to uſe many means; but becauſe the King commanded him to be always near him, and kept a continual Eye over him, he was not able to ſtir out of his ſight; which exceedingly troubling <hi>Emir</hi> made him take a ſtrange Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which put the King in no ſmall danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both.

After <hi>Oranch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zef</hi> had reſted his Army two or three days, and by retarding the Enemy, had ſo order'd his Buſineſs, that he could get over the Stream, he commanded his Guns which were planted along the Bank of the River, to Diſcharge on the Enemy whilſt his Men croſs'd the Water.

               <p>In the interim <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> clearly perceiving the Deſign of <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Moradbeck,</hi> and that he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63517:134"/>had no hopes of perſwading them to return, he knew not in that Exigent what to do; fain he would have prevented this Battel, on which all depended, and to which <hi>Darasja</hi> made all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Preparations; but what could he do to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it? he was ſtill very weak, and in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Darasja,</hi> in whom, as is ſaid before, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd no great confidence; wherefore he was forc'd to leave the management of all things to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and ſurrendred to him the chief Forts and Caſtles in his Dominions, and likewiſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his Officers to obey him. Whereupon all Perſons were immediately put into Arms, ſo that an Army was form'd, as it was reported, of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot, and a vaſt Train of Artillery: Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this was the moſt compleat and biggeſt Army that ever was ſeen in <hi>Hindoſtan,</hi> and ſufficient to defeat three or four ſuch as that of <hi>Oranchzef</hi> (who had not above thirty five or forty thouſand Men in all, and thoſe tir'd and ſpent by their long and troubleſom March, by reaſon of the exceſſive Heats) a thing almoſt incredible, there was ſcarce one Perſon, but ominouſly preſag'd <hi>Darasja</hi>'s ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, eſpecially becauſe none of the <hi>Omrahs</hi> had any reſpect or kindneſs for him, and all the prime Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on whom his dependance lay, were in <hi>Soliman Chekou</hi>'s Army. To venture a Battel, all his Friends, as well as <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> diſſwaded him from. His Father alſo proffer'd himſelf in the heighth of his Sickneſs, to be carry'd into the Field before <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> which undoubtedly would have been a great introducement to Peace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very beneficial to <hi>Schach Jehan:</hi> for certainly <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Moradbeck</hi> would never have dar'd to fight againſt their own Father; and though they had bin powerful enough to have attempted, they would certainly have ſuffer'd for it, not onely becauſe their Forces were not equal, and all the great <hi>Omrahs</hi> were ſo fix'd for <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> that they would not have fail'd, ſeeing him in the Head of the Army, to have fought very reſolutely, but alſo becauſe that <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Moradbeck</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders had ſo great an affection for this Prince, whoſe Creatures moſt of them were, that they would have turn'd their Swords againſt them their Generals, and perſwaded the whole Army to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves for their old Prince. Then they perſwaded <hi>Darasja,</hi> ſince he would not hearken to any Advice, not to march with his Army into the Field, but to ſtay till <hi>Soliman Chekou</hi> came to joyn with him, which would be very ſuddenly, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already on his March to <hi>Agra;</hi> which alſo was good Counſel, becauſe he was a Perſon belov'd by all, having return'd victoriouſly, and the moſt loyal and brave Soldiers being ſtill in his Army. But <hi>Darasja</hi> would not regard any Propoſitions that were offer'd to him, how reaſonable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſoever, thinking on nothing but giving ſpeedy Battel to <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> whom he reſolv'd to Encounter in Perſon; and certainly he did not amiſs herein, in reſpect to his own Honor and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt, if Fortune had befriended him; but things fell not out as he had contriv'd them, and very probably for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>He look'd upon himſelf as Maſter of <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> whom he knew he could ſway as he pleas'd: He was at that time Owner of all his Treaſures and ſtrong Holds: <hi>Chaſauſa</hi> was half defeated, and his two other Brothers came with a faint and tir'd Army to throw themſelves into his Hands, which they could not miſs if he won the Battel: That then he ſhould at once be abſolute Maſter, at the end of all his Troubles, and attain to the heighth of his Wiſhes without any ones contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; when as on the contrary, if his Father ſhould go into the Field, all Affairs would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, and his Brothers return to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: Moreover, that if he ſhould ſtay for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman Chekou</hi> his Son, <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> might plot ſome Deſign to his Diſadvantage, or contrive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with <hi>Oranchzef;</hi> and that whatever he ſhould do to gain the Victory, the Reputation his Son had already gotten, would give him all the Honor thereof: What would not he be capable to undertake, ſwoln with ſo much Glory and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and eſpecially being ſupported as he was by the Favor and Affection of <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> and the greateſt part of the <hi>Omrahs?</hi> What did he know whether he would keep any Reſpect or Duty for his Father, and what his Ambition might prompt him to?</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations made <hi>Darasja</hi> conclude to refuſe all Perſons Advice, and act according to his own Humor, and thereupon immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his whole Army to march into the Field, and went himſelf to take his leave of his Father, then in the Caſtle of <hi>Agra,</hi> who ſhed a multitude of Tears, embracing him, and thus beſpeaking him; <hi>Well,</hi> Darasja, <hi>you are reſolv'd to follow your own Will, go, and God bleſs you; but remember theſe few words; if you loſe the Battel, take heed of ever coming into my Preſence.</hi> But all this making no great impreſſion on him, he went away boldly, and taking Horſe, rode with his Army to block up the Paſſage through the River <hi>Schembel,</hi> about twelve Leagues from <hi>Agra;</hi> where Intrenching himſelf, he reſolutely expected his Enemy. But <hi>Oranch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zef</hi> (who being more ſubtil and crafty, wanted not good Spyes, that inform'd him of all Tranſactions) knowing it there to be very difficult, never attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to force it, but coming to Encamp himſelf on the other ſide, oppoſite to <hi>Darasja</hi>'s Army, was ſeen by them, whilſt he ſent to a rebellious <hi>Raja,</hi> nam'd <hi>Chempet,</hi> ſeveral rich Preſents, and made him many Promiſes, if he would permit him to march through his Countrey, that ſo he might find a place where the River was more fordable. <hi>Chempet</hi> not onely conſented, but proffer'd to be his Guide, to lead him croſs his Countrey through the Woods and Mountains. Whereupon <hi>Oranchzef</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Camp privately in the Night, left onely ſome Tents ſtanding, thereby to amuſe <hi>Darasja,</hi> and marching night and day, got over the River before he had any notice thereof; but as ſoon as ever he receiv'd the news, he left his Station, and haſted to Engage his Enemy, who was ſaid to march with great ſpeed towards <hi>Agra,</hi> to gain the River <hi>Gemna,</hi> and there without trouble, and at his pleaſure to uſe the Water, and fortifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, expect <hi>Darasja</hi>'s coming. This Place, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly call'd <hi>Samongues,</hi> and now <hi>Fatabad,</hi> that is, <hi>The Place of Victory,</hi> is not above three Leagues from <hi>Agra.</hi> Not long after <hi>Darasja</hi> appearing on the Shore of the ſaid River, Encamp'd with his Army between <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> whilſt <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> wrote ſeveral Letters to <hi>Darasja,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that <hi>Soliman Chekou</hi> was not far off, and therefore it would be prudence in him not to begin the Battel, but to draw nearer to <hi>Agra,</hi> and chuſe a good place where he might fortifie himſelf, and expect his Son's coming. But <hi>Darasja</hi> return'd him in anſwer, That before three days paſs'd, he would bring <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Moradbeck</hi> bound Hand and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63517:135"/>Foot before him, to puniſh them as he ſhould think fit; and without any farther delay, at the ſame hour drew out his Army, planted all his Guns before, and faſtned them together with Iron Chains, to prevent the Enemy's Horſe from breaking in upon him; behind theſe Guns he alſo plac'd many Camels, each with a Muſquet made faſt on their Breaſt, which a Man might Charge or Diſcharge without ſetting a Foot on the Ground; behind theſe Camels were drawn up the greateſt part of the Muſqueteers, and behind them the reſt of the Army, which chiefly conſiſted in Horſe Arm'd with Sword, Bowes, and, a Quiver full of Arrows, as commonly the <hi>Mogols</hi> (by which Name are underſtood the white People, as <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, Perſians, Turks, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Usbeques</hi>) or with a Sword and a Half-pike, like thoſe which the <hi>Ragipous</hi> carry.<note place="margin">The Wings how order'd, and their ſtrength.</note> Of all theſe foremention'd ſorts of Men he made three Bodies; the right Wing whereof, being Commanded by <hi>Cali-lullah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> conſiſted in thirty thouſand <hi>Mogols;</hi> the left was Commanded by <hi>Ruſtam-kan Dakny,</hi> a very eminent and valiant Commander, beſides <hi>Raja Chatreſale</hi> and <hi>Raja Ramſeingue Routle.</hi> Mean while <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Moradbeck</hi> on the oppoſite ſide, drew out their Army almoſt after the ſame manner, onely they privately plac'd in the midſt of the Troops of ſome <hi>Omrahs,</hi> ſeveral Field-pieces (an Invention of <hi>Emir Jemla</hi>) with no ill effect; they alſo plac'd here and there ſeveral Men to throw <hi>Bannes,</hi> which being a ſort of Granadoes faſtned to a Stick, are caſt amongſt the Horſe, which often frighting them, puts them into diſorder, and many times do great miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Horſe very expert.</note>All their Horſe fall back and draw up with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſwiftneſs, and Diſcharge ſix ſeveral Flights of Arrows ſooner than the Muſquets two Volleys: They alſo keep cloſe together in a Body under their reſpective Officers, eſpecially when they come up to Fight Hand to Hand with their Swords.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Battel.</note>Being thus drawn out, the Guns began to play from both ſides, (for they always Diſcharge their Cannons firſt,) and Arrows were now ſeen to flie through the Air, when on a ſudden there fell a mighty Shower of Rain, that interrupted the Combat, which began again as ſoon as it ceas'd: <hi>Darasja</hi> mounted on a ſtately Elephant, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Men to fall on on all ſides, whilſt he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midſt of a Body of Horſe directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Enemies Artillery, which receiv'd him ſo valiantly, that abundance of Men were kill'd round about him; and not onely that Body which he Commanded put into diſorder, but alſo the other Horſe that follow'd him; nevertheleſs he being ſeen to ſit firm on his Elephant, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to retreat, and courageouſly looking about, and making ſigns with his Hands, to advance and follow him: This diſorder ſoon ceas'd, and every Man reſuming his Rank, march'd on with him; but he could not reach his Enemy before he was ſaluted with another Volley of Cannon-ſhot, which caus'd a ſecond and great Diſorder amongſt his Men, making many of them Retreat; yet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasja</hi> without changing his Countenance, ſat faſt on his Elephant, and encourag'd his Men, giving them ſtill ſigns to follow him, and to advance with all poſſible ſpeed, without any loſs of time: Thus vigorouſly preſſing forward, he forc'd the Enemies Artillery, broke their Chains, entred into their Camp, and hewing down the Camels and Infantry which ſtood in his way on that ſide, he open'd a good Paſſage for the Cavalry that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him; when the Enemy's Horſe facing him, they began a fierce Combat: A ſhower of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows fill'd the Air from both ſides, <hi>Darasja</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf letting flie ſeveral amongſt them. But theſe Arrows do but little Execution, moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken either in the Air, or faln on the Ground without doing any hurt. The firſt flight of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows being made, they fell upon one annother with their Swords, whilſt <hi>Darasja</hi> ſitting ſtill on his Elephant, encourag'd his Soldiers, call'd and made ſigns to them, and at laſt advanc'd with ſo much reſolution and force againſt all that oppos'd him, that he overthrew the Cavalry, and forc'd them to retreat and flie. <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> who alſo ſat on an Elephant, ſeeing this diſorder, was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly perplex'd, yet labour'd with all his might to defend them, though to little purpoſe; wherefore he drew up the Body wherein his choiceſt Men were, to make a Head againſt <hi>Darasja,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forc'd them to retreat in great diſorder, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that <hi>Oranchzef</hi> could do to hinder it; yet nevertheleſs he loſt neither his Valour nor Courage, though he ſaw the whole Army in a confus'd and flying poſture, inſomuch that he had not above a thouſand, ſome ſay but five hundred, that ſtood to defend him; he alſo ſaw that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasja,</hi> notwithſtanding the difficulty of the Way, which was uneven and full of Holes in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, made as if he would ruſh in upon him; yet ſtill his Courage abated not, but he kept his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the leaſt apprehenſion of fear, or thought of retreating; and calling every one of his Commanders that were about him by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Names, cry'd out <hi>Delirane Codahi,</hi> that is, <hi>Take courage, my old Friends, God is; what hope is there in flying? know you not where our</hi> Decan <hi>is? Codahi, Codahi, God is, God is;</hi> and that none might doubt his Valour, but ſee how far his Heart was from recoiling, he inſtantly commanded in the preſence of them all, that Chains ſhould be put on his Elephants Feet; which had certainly been done, but that all thoſe that were near him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd their courage and reſolution to live and die with him. Mean while <hi>Darasja</hi> endeavor'd to break in upon him, though he was a good diſtance from him, but the difficulty of the Way much hindred him, and alſo the oppoſition he met with from the diſorder'd Horſe, which cover'd all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he was to paſs. This Encounter with <hi>Oranch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zef</hi> he look'd upon as that which was to aſſure him of the Victory and decide the Battel; and doubtleſs he would have overcome all the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Difficulties, and <hi>Oranchzef</hi> with the ſmall number which he had left, would not have been able to reſiſt his, till then, victorious Army; but <hi>Darasja</hi> not knowing how to make uſe of his advantage, fail'd in the whole, of which I will now ſhew you the occaſion, and how thereby the Scale turn'd to <hi>Oranchzef</hi>'s advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darasja</hi> perceiving that his left Wing was in great diſorder, was inform'd, that <hi>Cuſtam-kan</hi> and <hi>Chatreſale</hi> were both kill'd; that <hi>Ramſeingue Routle</hi> having advanc'd very far, had forc'd the Enemy, and made way through the midſt of them, but was now encompaſs'd by them, and in great danger; all which made <hi>Darasja</hi> deſiſt from his Deſign, of making directly towards <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> and turn to aſſiſt his left Wing, where the Fight in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was very ſmart; but <hi>Darasja</hi> at laſt got the Victory, forcing and routing all that oppos'd him, yet not ſo, but that there ſtill remain'd ſome
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63517:135"/>to reſiſt and ſtop him. Mean while <hi>Ramſeingue Routle</hi> fought with great courage and valour, wounded <hi>Moradbeck,</hi> and came up ſo near to him, that he began to cut the Girts of his Elephant, ſo to throw him down to the Ground; but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and good fortune of <hi>Moradbeck</hi> allow'd him not time enough for it:<note place="margin">

To this end he wrote divers Letters to the <hi>Raja Jeſſeingue,</hi> and to <hi>Delilcan,</hi> the Prime Commanders of <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi>'s Army, telling them, <q>That there was no more hopes to be built on <hi>Darasja</hi> and his Party; That he had loſt the Battel, his whole Army having aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him, and ſubmitted themſelves to him; and that he being fled alone to <hi>Deli,</hi> could not poſſibly eſcape his Hands, he having laid wait in all Places to ſeiſe on him.</q> As to what concern'd <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> he told them, <q>That he was in a deſperate condition, and beyond any hopes of recovery; That they ſhould take great care what they did, and if they were People of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and deſirous to ſhare in his Fortune, and to be his Friends, they ſhould ſeize on <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chekouh,</hi> and bring him to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſſeingue</hi> found himſelf ſufficiently perplex'd in what he had to do, exceedingly fearing <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> and more to lay Hands on a Royal Perſon, well knowing, that at one time or other ſome miſchief might befal him even from <hi>Oranchzef</hi> himſelf. Beſides, he knew that <hi>Soliman Chekouh</hi> had too much Courage to ſuffer himſelf to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after that manner, and that he would rather die in defending himſelf. Wherefore having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with <hi>Delilcan</hi> his great Friend, and after they had renew'd their Oaths of Mutual Fidelity, he went directly to the Tent of <hi>Soliman Chekouh,</hi> who with great impatience expected him, (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo heard the News of his Father's being defeated) and had already ſent for him ſeveral times: He then made the Prince a free diſcovery of all things, ſhew'd him the Letter of <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> told him what courſe was beſt for him to take, repreſented to him the danger he was in, adding, That there was no reaſon he ſhould repoſe any confidence in <hi>Delilcan,</hi> or in <hi>Daoudcan,</hi> or any of the reſt of his Army; but that as ſoon as was poſſible he ſhould flie to the Mountains of <hi>Serena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,</hi> which would be the beſt Expedient he could take: for the <hi>Raja</hi> of that Countrey being in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible Places, and not knowing <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> would undoubtedly receive him with much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and from thence he might from time to time ſee how things would go, and always be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to return again when he pleas'd. But the young Prince immediately apprehended by this Diſcourſe, that henceforth there was no great confidence to be put in <hi>Jeſſeingue,</hi> and that there was no ſafety there for his Perſon, becauſe he knew <hi>Delilcan</hi> to be of his Party; ſo that he ſaw there was a neceſſity of making uſe of <hi>Jeſſeingue</hi>'s Counſel: Whereupon commanding his Baggage to be pack'd up, he immediately march'd towards the Mountains. Some of his moſt affectionate Friends, as a good number of <hi>Manſebdars, Saieds,</hi> and others, went along to attend him; whilſt the reſt of the Army, altogether aſtoniſh'd, remain'd with <hi>Jeſſeingue.</hi> But that which was very mean, and a baſe and ſordid act of ſuch eminent Perſons, was, that <hi>Jeſſeingue</hi> and <hi>Delilcan</hi> ſent a Party after him, to rob him of his Baggage, and alſo, among other things, an Elephant laden with golden <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> which caus'd great diſorder amongſt thoſe ſmall Troops that follow'd him, occaſioning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to deſert him, and return to the Army; and, to compleat his misfortune, the Countrey People alſo ſet upon his Men, pillaging and deſtroying ſeveral of them. Yet nevertheleſs he got to the Mountains with his Wife and Children, where the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Serenaguer</hi> receiv'd him with all the Honour and Civility he could deſire, aſſuring him alſo, that he was as much in ſafety as the King of that Countrey, and that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and aſſiſt him with all his Forces.

                  </note>
                  <hi>Oranchzef</hi> on his part alſo ſaw, that he was not to truſt too much in his Fathers words, well knowing, that <hi>Begum Saheb,</hi> his Enemy as well as his Siſter, was night and day about him, and that it was very probable he acted nothing without her advice: He apprehended likewiſe, that if he ſhould come unto the Fortreſs, he might be ſeiz'd on, and ill treated; it being indeed, according to report, ſo reſolv'd on, and that ſeveral of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Women which ſerve in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were armed to ſet upon him ſo ſoon as he ſhould enter into the Caſtle; yet however it was, <hi>Oranchzef</hi> would not hazard himſelf, though he caus'd it to be rumor'd abroad, that the next day he intended to viſit his Father; but when the time was come, he ſent away the People which came to wait on him till the next day, and ſo prolong'd the time, by putting them off from one day to another, inſomuch that he never went. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while he continu'd his ſecret Counſels and Cabals, and ſounded the minds of all the greateſt <hi>Omrahs</hi> ſo far, that at laſt, after he had well and cloſely laid his Deſign, and politickly diſpos'd all things for the ſucceſs thereof, he ſent his eldeſt Son <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Mahmoud</hi> into the Caſtle, under a pretence of ſpeaking with his Father; who was no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but he fell boldly upon the firſt Sentinel, and drove away all that oppos'd him, whilſt a great number of Men appointed for that purpoſe, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their paſſage after him, immediately made themſelves Maſters of the Walls, which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aſtoniſh'd <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> he ſeeing himſelf taken in the ſame Snare which he had prepar'd for another, impriſon'd in his own Palace, and <hi>Oranchzef</hi> Maſter of the Fort: 'Tis ſaid that he preſently ſent to try the temper of <hi>Sultan Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud,</hi> and promis'd him by his Crown and the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> That if he would be faithful to him, and ſerve him in this Conjuncture, he would make him King; and that in order thereunto, he ſhould immediately come to him, and not ſlip this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: Beſides that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the Bleſſings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and an immortal Glory, in regard it would be ſaid for ever, That <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> his Grandfather out of Priſon. And certainly if <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> had been reſolute enough to undertake the Work, and <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> could have come abroad to ſhew himſelf to the Town, and to take the Field, no Man doubts but all his great <hi>Omrahs</hi> would have follow'd him, nor would <hi>Oranchzef</hi> have had the boldneſs to fight againſt his own Father in Perſon, eſpecially ſince he muſt have apprehended, that all the World would have abandon'd him, and poſſibly <hi>Moradbech</hi> himſelf. And thus it appears that <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> committed a great error, that he did not come out of the Caſtle after the Battel and <hi>Darasja</hi>'s Flight; though, as others affirm, he did very prudently therein. The ſame Reaſoners maintain, That the greateſt fault which <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> could poſſibly commit, was, that he knew not how to make uſe of this occaſion to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf of the Crown, by the moſt generous Action that ever he could be capable of, to ſet hi Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do himſelf Right and Juſtice, as the Sovereign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things then ſtood, he muſt one day go and die in <hi>Govaleor:</hi> But <hi>Sultan Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud</hi> (whether he fear'd that <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> would not keep his Word, or durſt not diſpleaſe his Father) would not hearken to any Offers, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the King's Appartment, alledging, That he had no Order from his Father to ſee him; but that he was by him commanded not to return from thence without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortreſs, that ſo he might come with all ſafety and kiſs his Majeſties Feet. Two days were paſt before it could be reſolv'd whether the Keys ſhould be deliver'd to him; during which, <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> watch'd night and day with all his Troops about him; till at length <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> ſeeing all the Guards which watch'd at the little Gate to disband one after another, and perceiving no more ſafety on his part, deliver'd the ſame to him, with Order to tell <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> that he ſhould come and ſee him that day, if he were wiſe; for he had Buſineſs of grand concern to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him: But <hi>Oranchzef</hi> being too ſubtile to commit ſo great an error, inſtantly made his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch <hi>Etharcan</hi> Governor of the Fort, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lock'd up <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> with his Daughter <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Saheb,</hi> and all his Women, cauſing many Gates to be ſtopp'd up, that ſo he might neither ſpeak nor write to any body, nor go out of his Appartment without leave.

                  <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> who for the foremention'd Reaſons was grown very inſolent, and perhaps at that time aſpir'd to greater things than he ought, pretended to command the Army abſolutely, and that <hi>Emir Jemla</hi> ſhould follow his Orders, letting alſo from time to time many inſolent Words fall in reference to his Father <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> as if he were oblig'd to him for the Crown, and utter'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and threatning Expreſſions againſt <hi>Emir Jemla,</hi> which caus'd a great coolneſs between them; but at laſt, <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> being inform'd that his Father was much diſſatisfied with his ill Conduct, and fearing that <hi>Emir</hi> might have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſecure his Perſon, he went, accompanied with a ſmall number of Men, to <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa,</hi> to whom ſwearing Fidelity, he made great Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But <hi>Chaſauſa,</hi> who look'd upon it as a Plot of <hi>Oranchzef</hi> and <hi>Emir,</hi> durſt not confide in him, but kept a continual Eye over him, and gave him no conſiderable Command; which ſo diſſatisfied him, that ſome Months after he concluded to leave <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa,</hi> and went again to <hi>Emir Jemla,</hi> who favorably receiving him, promis'd to write in his behalf to <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> whom he would endeavor to perſwade to forget and pardon his Errors.</p>

But however it was, he ſhew'd himſelf much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with him; yet at laſt he wrote him a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Pardon, and commanded him alſo to come ſpeedily to <hi>Deli:</hi> But in the interim he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he ſhould not come ſo far: for no ſooner had <hi>Sultan Mahmoud</hi> croſs'd the <hi>Ganges,</hi> but he met with a Party appointed to ſeize him, who locking him up in an <hi>Embory</hi> (after the ſame manner as they had done <hi>Moradbech</hi>) carried him to <hi>Govaleor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Oranchzef</hi> freeing himſelf from great perplexity, told his ſecond Son, that the Point of Reigning was ſo tickliſh a thing, that Kings muſt be jealous of their own Shadow: Therefore if he were not diſcreet and careful, the ſame thing might happen to him as had befallen his Brother; but that whilſt he kept himſelf within the bounds of his Duty and Obedience, he ſhould find him a loving and indulgent Father: Proteſting likewiſe, That he intended not to offer the leaſt violence to the Perſon of <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> his Father. But <hi>Oranchzef</hi> had at this time no occaſion to ſuſpect his Son <hi>Sultan Mazum,</hi> or to be diſſatisfied with him; for never was any Slave more humble: nor did ever <hi>Oranchzef</hi> himſelf appear more careleſs of Greatneſs, nor more given to Devotion, than <hi>Sultan Mazum:</hi> Yet ſome knowing Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that he was not ſo in reality, but by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Policy and Craft, like his Father, of which we may have a Proof in time.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Matters were thus tranſacted in <hi>Bengala,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa</hi> oppos'd <hi>Emir Jemla</hi> the beſt he could, <hi>Emir</hi> marching firſt on one ſide of the

                  </note> which Arguments prevailing, he was ſet upon an Elephant, with his two Nephews on each ſide, and behind him <hi>Badurcan</hi> in ſtead of the Executioner: This was none of thoſe ſtately Elephants from <hi>Geylon</hi> or <hi>Pegu,</hi> richly capariſon'd, on which he us'd to Ride, but an old poor dirty Beaſt, with a ragged Cover, and a pitiful Seat all open: He had then no more the Necklace of Pearls which thoſe Princes uſe to wear, nor thoſe rich <hi>Turbants</hi> and embroider'd Veſtures, his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being a Veſt of dirty courſe Linnen, and a <hi>Turbant</hi> of the ſame, with a tatter'd Scarf of <hi>Cackmire</hi> over his Head like a Varlet; his Son <hi>Sepe Chekouh</hi> was in the ſame Equipage. In this miſerable poſture he was made to enter into the Town, and to paſs through the high Streets, to the end he might be ſeen by all People, and by that means fully ſatisfie all thoſe, who till then very much doubted that it was not he. Moſt People were exceedingly amaz'd at the boldneſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him paſs through the Town, and the more, becauſe he was but ill guarded, and exceedingly belov'd by the Vulgar, who at that time exclaim'd highly againſt the cruelty and tyranny of <hi>Oranch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zef,</hi> as one that kept his Father in Priſon, and alſo his own Son <hi>Sultan Mahmoud,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radbeck;</hi> but not one Man had the boldneſs to draw his Sword, onely there were ſome of the <hi>Fakiers,</hi> and ſome poor People, who ſeeing that infamous <hi>Gioncan</hi> ride by his ſide, began to rail and throw ſtones at him, and to call him Traitor; and indeed all the tops of the Houſes and Shops being throng'd with Spectators, there was nothing heard but loud Outcries and Lamentations, with Invectives and Curſes heap'd upon <hi>Gioncan;</hi> in a word, both Men and Women, great and ſmall, ſo compaſſionate are the <hi>Indians,</hi> were ready to melt into Tears, yet none durſt attempt to reſcue him.

                  <note place="margin">A Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put him to death, or ſend him to <hi>Govaleor.</hi>
                  </note>Several Perſons of Quality that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were not wanting to tell <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> that moſt of the People ſeeing <hi>Darasja</hi> paſs by, lamented for him very much, and curſing the <hi>Patan</hi> that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd him, were ready to ſtone him to death, and conſequently there was great fear of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection or Diſturbance.

               </p>
               <p>The Charge of this Tragical Execution was given to a certain Slave call'd <hi>Nazer,</hi> who had been bred up by <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> and was known to have been miſus'd by <hi>Darasja.</hi> This Executioner,

               <p>When this young and noble Perſon, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beautiful and well proportion'd, was ſeen to enter the Gates, many <hi>Omrahs</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Tears.

And here comes the Concluſion of this whole Tragedy:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chaſauſa</hi> flies for refuge to the King of <hi>Racan.</hi>
                  </note> For this Prince being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whether to betake himſelf, ſent his eldeſt Son <hi>Sultan Banque</hi> to the King of <hi>Racan,</hi> or <hi>Moy,</hi> a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> to know whether he would permit him to make his Court his Place of Refuge for ſome time, and do him the favor, when the <hi>Mouſons</hi> or Trade-Winds ſhould come, to furniſh him with a Veſſel to <hi>Mecha,</hi> that from thence he might paſs into ſome Parts of <hi>Turkey</hi> or <hi>Perſia.</hi> The King return'd <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa</hi> word, That he ſhould be very welcom to him, and have all poſſible Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: With which Anſwer <hi>Sultan Banque</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Dake,</hi> the King having alſo ſupply'd with ſeveral Galleys, (Mann'd with <hi>Franks, viz.

To get out of their Hands, one muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be very Powerful, or at leaſt have nothing that may tempt their Avarice. And the more <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa</hi> implor'd for a Ship, the further he was from having it; the King on the contrary beginning to grow very cool, and complaining that he did not come to ſee him.</p>
               <p>It is not known whether <hi>Sultan Chaſauſa</hi> look'd upon it as a diſhonor to himſelf, and a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, to go and viſit a King; or whether he fear'd that he might ſecure his Perſon when he ſhould come into his Palace, and ſo make himſelf Maſter of all his Treaſure, and deliver him to <hi>Emir Jemla,</hi> who promis'd him great Sums of Money, and many other conſiderable Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to do the ſame: However it was, he would not go thither, but ſent his Son <hi>Sultan Banque,</hi> who being come near the King's Houſe, ſhew'd his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality to the People, throwing handfuls of <hi>Ropias</hi> of Gold and Silver amongſt them; and coming before the King, he preſented him with ſeveral Embroider'd Coats, and wrought Pieces of Gold, beſet with Precious Stones, and excus'd his Father <hi>Chaſauſa</hi>'s not coming, by alledging he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd; deſiring him alſo to furniſh him with a Ship, and perform the Promiſes which he had made to him: But all this avail'd not; for five or ſix days after, the King ſent to <hi>Sultan Chauſaſa,</hi> to requeſt one of his Daughters in Marriage, which he not granting, ſo highly incens'd this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, that he ſuffer'd <hi>Chaſauſa</hi> to be driven to great Extremities, the Seaſon for putting to Sea being now paſt: When, behold, he took a ſtrange Reſolution, which may give a great Example of what Deſpair can do.</p>

               <p>It is a wonder that this Fortreſs of <hi>Candahar,</hi> ſtanding on the Borders of two mighty Kingdoms, and having been ſo often conteſted for, was not better furniſh'd with Ammunition and Proviſions; but perhaps the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſuppos'd that his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, whom <hi>Schach Abbas</hi> put off with Delays, would have concluded a Peace, the Soldiers in Garriſon elſe fighting very valiantly, inſomuch that they could not be diſcern'd to abate any thing of their courage, notwithſtanding the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd want.</p>
               <p>After the conquering of the City, a <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſeman or <hi>Quizilbaſci,</hi> was commanded to ſtand upon the Guard without the Gate, till ſuch time as all the <hi>Indoſtan</hi> Soldiers were come out of the fame, as a teſtimony of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Indoſtans:</hi> he was Accoutred in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> On his Back hung a Tyger's Skin; on his Head, in ſtead of a <hi>Turbant,</hi> he wore a round Copper Helmet, with a Plume of Feathers, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down behind on both ſides of the ſame; in his Hand he held a Truncheon.</p>
               <p>On the fifth day after the Conqueſt, the <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> Soldiers march'd out of the City to <hi>Cabul,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight days Journey from <hi>Candahar:</hi> They were, according to the Agreement, not allow'd to take any thing with them, more than what each Man could carry on his Horſe, and not without being ſearch'd, becauſe ſome things were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them to meddle with. The Citizens for the moſt part promiſing to be obedient to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſtaid in the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Myrub Chan,</hi> who had conquer'd the Fortreſs <hi>Buſt,</hi> was made Governor of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and charg'd on pain of Death to be very careful in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Schach Abbas</hi> had conquer'd the City and Fortreſs of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and given order for repairing of the demoliſh'd Walls, he went with his Army back to the City of <hi>Herat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some days after <hi>Myrub Chan,</hi> the new-made Governor of <hi>Candahar,</hi> ſent a flying Poſt to the King, to inform him, That it was certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the <hi>Mogol</hi> was coming towards <hi>Candahar</hi> with ſix hundred thouſand Men, and that one of his Sons was already entred into the City <hi>Cabul</hi> with ten thouſand Men; which being affirm'd by ſeveral Meſſengers that came one after another, the King ſent his <hi>Chans</hi> back with the Army im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Candahar,</hi> where the <hi>Perſians</hi> in good order expected the <hi>Mogol</hi> to give him Battel: The <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Army coming thither three days after, Encamp'd at firſt about half a Mile diſtant from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whilſt the Trumpets ſounding, the

                  <hi>Indoſtans</hi> with loud ſhouts fell in amongſt their Troops, which conſiſted moſt in Oxen, and ſome ordinary <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſes, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſes being too dear for a common <hi>Mogol</hi> Trooper to buy. The Battel being very fierce at firſt, the <hi>Perſians</hi> behav'd themſelves very valiantly; and when their Reſerve came up with them, they unawares fell upon both Wings of the Enemy, breaking their Ranks, and killing their General (who had behav'd himſelf nobly, but ventur'd too far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi>) and putting them to flight, kill'd great numbers of them in the purſuit; yet there were about ſix thouſand <hi>Perſian,</hi> and not above two thouſand <hi>Indoſtans</hi> ſlain in this Battel. The <hi>Indoſtans</hi> left all their Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to the diſpoſal of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Mogol</hi> having no mind to adventure any farther, march'd back with his Army.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1664. <hi>F.

               <p>In or between the Mountains which belong to <hi>Cachemire,</hi> are many fertile Plains, and amongſt others, one which pays Hides and Wooll for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which the Governor ſends for yearly.</p>

               <p>The Merchants of <hi>Cachemire</hi> go yearly from Mountain to Mountain to buy up the Wooll, of which they make a certain Stuff call'd <hi>Chales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another Place very remote from <hi>Cachemire,</hi> which alſo pays Tribute in Hides and Wooll, and poſſeſſes very many pleaſant and fruitful ſmall Plains and Valleys, which produce Wheat, Rice, Apples, Pears, Apricocks, Melons, and Grapes, of which the Owners make excellent Wine.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants have often refus'd to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, on the account of the troubleſom, and almoſt inacceſſible Ways that lead into their Countrey; but there have ever been means found to get into their Juriſdiction, to reduce them to Obedience.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the Mountains which lie farther off, and not under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Cachemire,</hi> are very pleaſant Tracts of Lands, inhabited by a white and well ſhap'd People, who ſeldom come from thence.</p>

               </p>
               <p>All theſe Rivulets gliding from the Mountains, make the low Lands exceeding fertile, inſomuch that the whole Kingdome is like a Garden, which being all over green, hath here and there ſome Villages ſituate amongſt the Trees, and is divided into ſeveral Beds, Sow'n with Rice, Wheat, and other Grain, beſides Saffron and Hemp, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with Water-courſes, Channels, and ſome little Lakes and Rivulets, and every where planted with <hi>European</hi> Trees and Flowers, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, Nuts, and Vines.</p>

                  </note>The chief Town of this Countrey bears the ſame Denomination with the Kingdom, and being without Walls, is three quarters of a Mile long, and half a Mile broad. It is ſituate in a barren Field, about two Leagues from the Mountains, which ſeem to make a Semi-circle about a Lake of ſweet Water, of about four or five Leagues in circumference. This Lake is made by running Springs and Brooks which glide from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and diſcharges its Water through a naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Channel, into a River which runs through the middle of the City, and hath two Bridges over it.</p>
               <p>This Lake is alſo full of Iſlands, which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo many pleaſant Gardens, with delightful Walks and Arbors, and are ſurrounded with Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and other Trees, which have Leaves about two Foot broad, and are as tall as the Maſts of Ships, with Boughs onely on the top like Date-trees.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the Lake, upon the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mountains, are alſo abundance of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſes and Gardens, for which that place is moſt convenient, becauſe it hath a delicate Air, a Proſpect on the Lake, Iſlands, and a City, and is full of Springs and Rivulets. The beſt of all the Gardens being the Kings, is in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call'd <hi>Schach-Limar,</hi> that is, <hi>The King's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> Out of the Lake they go into this Garden through a Channel between two rows of Trees planted along its Banks about five hundred Paces long.</p>
               <p>This Channel leads to the King's Sugar-houſe, which is alſo in the midſt of the Garden, where begins another brave Moat reaching to the upper end of the Garden.</p>
               <p>The bottom of the foremention'd Channel is pav'd with Freeſtone, and the ſides thereof rais'd alſo with the ſame Stone; in the middle thereof are many Springs of Water, which being in a row fifteen Paces diſtant one from another, ſhoot up above the other Water. Moreover, there are Receptacles of Water like Ponds, out of which by means of ſeveral Springs the Water riſes up in many ſmall Streams, which make divers Figures. This Channel ends at another great Banquetting-houſe, not much unlike the former.</p>
               <p>The foremention'd Pleaſure-houſes, built al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like Cloyſters, lying in the middle of the Moat, are ſurrounded with Water; between the two rows of Poplar Trees they have Galleries or Balconies built round about them, and four Doors oppoſite one to another; two whereof fronting the two rows of Trees, have two Bridges which lead croſs the Water, one on each ſide; the other two front the two ends of the Channel. Each Summer-houſe conſiſts in a great Room in the midſt of four leſſer, which make the Square; the Walls of both the great and ſmall Rooms are richly Gilded and Painted, and full of Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in large <hi>Perſian</hi> Characters; the four Doors are very ſtately, of large Stones, with two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns fetch'd out of the ancient <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples which <hi>Schach Jehan</hi> caus'd to be ruin'd. The value of theſe Stones is not known, nor of what ſpecies they are, unleſs Marble or Porphyrie.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Houſes are built of Wood two Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reys high, not for want of Stone, there being many old ruin'd <hi>Deuras</hi> or Temples, but for the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of the abundance of Wood which grows on the adjacent Mountains, from whence it may be fetch'd for a ſmall matter, and carried to the City along a little River.</p>
               <p>The Houſes built along the River ſide have each of them a Garden, which hath a Proſpect on the Water. The other Houſes that do not ſtand near the River have Gardens alſo, and many of them a little Channel, which runs into the Lake, into which they can Row from their Houſes in ſmall Boats</p>
               <p>At one end of the City appears a very ſteep Mountain, at the foot whereof are many fair Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with Gardens, and on the top a <hi>Moſque,</hi> with an Orchard and Garden belonging to it; In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof the Inhabitants in their Language call this Mountain <hi>Hary Porbet,</hi> that is, <hi>Green Mountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oppoſite to this appears another Mountain, being alſo crown'd with a <hi>Moſque,</hi> and likewiſe an ancient Structure, which ſeems to have been a <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> or <hi>Pagode;</hi> but it is call'd <hi>Tackt Souliman,</hi> that is, <hi>The Throne of Salomon,</hi> becauſe (as the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> ſay) <hi>Salomon</hi> built it when he came to <hi>Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">A wonderful Spring.</note>At the Confines of this Kingdom, two or three days Journey from the City <hi>Cachemire,</hi> a Spring near the foot of a Mountain works Wonders (as the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> affirm) in <hi>May,</hi> when the Snow melts on the Mountains, <hi>viz.</hi> it ebbs and flows for fifteen days together three times in a day, in the Morning, at Noon, and at Night; after the firſt fifteen days its Courſe is not ſo exact, and after a Months time it ſtops altogether the remaining part of the year, except in the time of great and long Rains, when it overflows like other Springs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> have on the Brink of this Spring, a little <hi>Deura</hi> or <hi>Pagode,</hi> built in honor of one of their Idols, wherefore they have call'd it <hi>Send Brary,</hi> as if they would ſay <hi>Water of Brary,</hi> whither many People go in Pilgrimage to Bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Many ſtrange Relations they give concerning the original of this Spring; the Mountain at whoſe foot it ſprings, extends in length from North to South, and appears at a diſtance like a Plain, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what riſing in the middle, and is about a hundred Paces broad on the top; the North ſide hath ſome Verdure, but quickly decaying for want of the Suns influence; the other ſide on the Weſt is ſhaded with Trees and Brambles.</p>
               <p>Some diſtance from the High-way is a pleaſant Seat of the ancient Kings of <hi>Cachemire,</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> call'd <hi>Achiavela.</hi> The moſt remarkable thing belonging thereunto is a Spring, whoſe Water runs round about the Structure, and through all the Gardens in many little Channels. This Spring boyls with ſuch great force out of the Earth, that it may rather be call'd a River than a Spring: The Water thereof is ſo exceeding cold, that one cannot hold ones Hand in it. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is very large and pleaſant, having many brave
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63517:149"/>Walks, and abundance of Fruit-trees, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, and Cherries, and alſo many Fountains and Fiſh-ponds.</p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Achiavel</hi> is another brave Royal Garden, in which are all the foremention'd things for recreation; but it excells in having a Pond full of Fiſh, which upon calling, or throwing of Bread into the ſame, appear above Water; the biggeſt of them have been ſeen with golden Rings in their Noſes, with Mottoes engraven on them, which are ſaid to have been put on by order of the famous <hi>Nourmehalle,</hi> Queen to the <hi>Great Mogol Schach Selim.</hi>

               <p>Near this <hi>Moſque</hi> is a Kitchin, in which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Copper Kettles full of Fleſh and Rice, which perhaps is the Load-ſtone that draws the Poor thither, and the Miracle which cures them.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide is a Garden, about which are Chambers for the <hi>Mollahs,</hi> who quietly ſpend their Lives there.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A wonderful Stone.</note>There is alſo another Wonder, <hi>viz.</hi> there is a thick round Stone, which the ſtrongeſt Man can ſcarce lift up from the Ground; yet nevertheleſs eleven Men, by the help of the foremention'd Saint, may take up the ſame without any trouble, by putting each of them onely one Finger thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleven</hi> Mollas (ſaith <hi>F. Bernier,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Anno</hi> 1664. at the working of this Miracle) <hi>ſtanding cloſe round about the ſaid Stone, with their long Coats prevented the exact diſcerning after what manner they lifted up the ſame; but all of them ſaid that they touch'd it not but onely with the ends of their Fingers, and that the Stone felt as light to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as a Spunge: As for my part, who well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them, and look'd upon them with a curious Eye, I could not perceive but that they took great pains, and made uſe of their Thumbs beſides their Fingers; yet I forgot not to cry with the reſt of the</hi> Mollas <hi>and other Spectators,</hi> Coramet, Coramet, <hi>that is,</hi> A Miracle, A Miracle, <hi>and at the ſame time gave a</hi> Ropia <hi>to the</hi> Mollas, <hi>earneſtly deſiring them to let me be one of the eleven which ſhould next lift up the ſame; which at firſt they would not grant, till throwing them another</hi> Ropia, <hi>and ſeeming really to believe the Miracle, one of them gave me his Place, they judging amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that ten of them would be enough, though I took no pains, to lift it up ſo nimbly that I ſhould not perceive them; but they were exceedingly deceiv'd: for the Stone, which I lifted not but with the end of my Finger, ſtirr'd not, till they puſhing the ſame on me, I was forc'd to put my Thumb to it alſo; in which manner we lifted the Stone, though with great trouble, from the Ground; yet when I ſaw they all look'd angrily upon me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Stranger, fear'd they might have ſton'd me, I readily cry'd out with the reſt,</hi> Coramet, <hi>and gave them another</hi> Ropia.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable diſtance from <hi>Baramoulay</hi> is a great Lake, through the midſt of which runs a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Baramoulay:</hi> It is full of Fiſh, eſpecially Eels, and ſwarms with Geeſe, wild Ducks, and other Water-fowl, which draws the Governor of <hi>Cachemire</hi> thither to ſpend the Winter.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of this Lake is a Cell, with a little Garden about it, which is ſaid to drive after a ſtrange manner upon the Water.</p>
               <p>In this Place a Recluſe ſpends his Life without ever coming from thence.</p>
               <p>They relate divers Stories concerning this Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, but by moſt it is generally believ'd, that an ancient King of <hi>Cachemire,</hi> out of curioſity built the ſame on great pieces of conjoyn'd Timber.</p>
               <p>About this Lake is alſo a remarkable Spring, which boyling leiſurely, riſes very ſlowly with little Bubbles, and alſo caſts up a certain fine Sand, which returns back to the bottom after the ſame manner as it came up: In a moment after the Water becomes ſtill, without boyling or caſting up the Sand, and then begins a freſh as before, yet without obſerving exact times between. It is ſaid that this Wonder proceeds from a Man's ſpeaking or ſtanding near the ſame, eſpecially if he ſtamp with his Foot againſt the Ground.</p>
               <p>In the Mountains is a great Lake, which is full of Ice in Summer, and reſembles a little Icy Sea; for the Winds breaking the Ice aſunder, moves the ſame up and down.</p>

They varniſh their Wood-work very curiouſly, and imitate the Veins of a certain Wood on any thing what they pleaſe, by Inlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Gold Wyres.</p>
               <p>But that which is remarkable and peculiar to theſe People, and that which brings a Trade and Money into their Countrey, is the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Saſhes or <hi>Chales,</hi> which they make, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teach their Children the Art of making them.

               <p>The <hi>Mogols</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> both Men and Women, wear them on their Heads, or throw them over their Shoulders like a Cloak: They make them of two ſeveral ſorts of Stuffs, namely Inland Wooll, which is much ſofter than the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and another ſort of Wooll, or rather Hair call'd <hi>Touz,</hi> which grows on the Breaſts of wild Goats which

               <p>
                  <hi>Maginus</hi> places this Kingdom between thoſe of <hi>Decan, Narſinga, Orixa,</hi> and <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Province of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> is ſeparated from the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaya</hi> by great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The River <hi>Jeming</hi> running along one ſide thereof, ſerves for a Moat, over which a Bridge with ten Arches leads into the City.</p>
               <p>The ancient Metropolis being alſo call'd <hi>Dely,</hi> was once a fair and large City, and the Seat and Burying-place of the <hi>Mogol</hi> Emperors, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards remov'd from thence to the new-built <hi>Dely.</hi> Its Glory conſiſted in many Tombs, in which above twenty great Kings and Lords lie buried. The ſuperſtitious <hi>Indians</hi> flock thither in Pilgrimage. It hath plenty of all things, and was anciently the Seat of King <hi>Porus,</hi> who near this Place was conquer'd by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> when he came to Invade him, with Elephants and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Horſes.</p>
               <p>Three Leagues from the City, on a place call'd <hi>Old Dely</hi> (where King <hi>Homayon,</hi> Father to <hi>Ecbar;</hi> lies buried) ſtands a great Marble Pillar or Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, which having a <hi>Greek</hi> Inſcription, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Remark in all the Province, notwithſtanding the Letters are almoſt worn out with age.</p>
               <p>About fifty years ago <hi>Schach Jehan,</hi> Father to the preſent <hi>Great Mogol Oranchzef,</hi> cauſing a City to be built not far from <hi>Old Dely,</hi> call'd it <hi>Schach Jehan Abad,</hi> that is, <hi>The Peopling of Schach Jeham,</hi> and made the ſame the Metropolis of the Realm in ſtead of <hi>Agra,</hi> where he ſaid the Heat was too great in Summer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jehan Abad</hi> 2 new City, how ſeated.</note>By reaſon of the nearneſs of the two foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Places, the Ruins of the old City hath ſerv'd for the new one, and there is at preſent ſcarce any mention made of <hi>Dely;</hi> but altogether of <hi>Jehan Abad,</hi> which is a new City, lying in a barren
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63517:150"/>Field on the Banks of the River <hi>Jemna,</hi> and built onely along one ſide of the Stream, there being but one Bridge over the ſame, which is laid croſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hulks: It is quite unwall'd on that ſide which reſpects the Water: The Walls are of Stone, yet not very tenible or defenſive, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Moats nor any Breaſtworks, but round Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after the old faſhion, about a hundred Paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from one another, and behind them a Mud Wall about four or five Foot thick: The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Wall, with the Caſtle which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd in the ſame, is about two Leagues and a half; but if you include a long Suburb which runs to <hi>Lahor,</hi> and being a Rellick of the old <hi>Dely,</hi> is inhabited, it will make above a League in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Line, and a Circumference which cannot juſtly be limited, becauſe between this Suburb and the City are ſpacious Gardens and Fields, without any Buildings. The Caſtle, within which is the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halle</hi> or <hi>Seraglio,</hi> beſides other Royal Apartments, is built round, orather in a Semi-circle, and looks upon the River; between which and the Walls is a large ſandy Plain, where they generally let the Elephants fight, and often Muſter the <hi>Rajas</hi> or, principal <hi>Omrahs</hi> Soldiers in the King's Preſence, who beholds the ſame out of his Hall Windows. The Walls of the Caſtle in reſpect of the round Towers, built after the old faſhion, are almoſt like thoſe of the City, but rais'd with Bricks and red Stones, which appearing like Marble, makes them much more beautiful than thoſe of the City, than which they are alſo much higher, ſtronger, thicker, and more ſubſtantial againſt ſmall Field-pieces. Beſides, it is ſurrounded, except on the Water ſide, with a Moat of good Water, abounding with Fiſh, rais'd on both ſides with Free-ſtone; yet nevertheleſs a Battery planted with great Guns may eaſily beat it down. Round about the Moat lies a large Garden, which in all Seaſons is full of green Trees and Flowers, which with the red Walls make a pleaſant Proſpect. Round about this Garden runs the great Street, or rather a great Royal Court or Plain, on which open two of the greateſt and chiefeſt Gates of the Caſtle, leading into the moſt eminent Streets of the City.</p>
               <p>On the foremention'd Plain alſo ſtand the Tents of the <hi>Rajas,</hi> who being in the King's Service, watch every week by turns, whilſt the <hi>Omrahs</hi> do the ſame Duty in the Caſtle, the <hi>Rajas</hi> delighting more to be in the Field, than lock'd up in the Fortreſs.</p>
               <p>On the ſaid Plain they alſo breathe the King's Horſes every Morning; it ſerves alſo for a <hi>Bazar</hi> or Market-place, where all ſorts of Merchandiſe are ſold, and is the Meeting-place of ſeveral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Aſtronomers, as well <hi>Mahumetans</hi> as <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo the great <hi>Cobatcan,</hi> or Commiſſary of the Horſe, takes a ſpecial Account of all the Troopers Horſes that enter into the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>viz.</hi> if he finds the Horſes to be <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> that is from <hi>Turkeſtan,</hi> or from <hi>Tartary,</hi> and big and able to do Service, then he marks them with a hot Iron on the Buttock with the King's Mark, and alſo the <hi>Omrahs</hi> under whom they Serve; and this is no ill Invention, to prevent the Troopers from lending their Horſes one to another.</p>
               <p>The foremention'd eminent Streets, which end over againſt the two Gates of the Caſtle, and on the Plain, are about twenty five or thirty Paces broad, and extend in a direct Line as far as the Eye can diſcern, though that which comes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gate of <hi>Lahor</hi> is much longer than the other, but all the Buildings are like one another. There are Arches on both ſides of the Streets, flat on the top, without any Rooms over the ſame; neither are the Walks underneath intire, but the Arches are ſeparated by Walls, the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which ſerves ſeveral Handicrafts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts for Shops to work in in the day-time, and for Exchangers of Money to do their Buſineſs in, and Merchants to diſpoſe their Commodities to Sale, which at Night they lock up in Warehouſes. The Arches over theſe Warehouſes are built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Merchants Houſes; which appear very fair at a diſtance, and are very convenient, for ſtanding very high, they are not onely out of the Duſt, but ſtand very cool, and being in a manner even with the flat Roof of the Arches, they walking on them, may look into the Street, and ſleep on the ſame for coolneſs in the Night. But beſides theſe two eminent Streets there are five others, which are not ſo direct nor ſtreight, but very like them in all things elſe. Many other Streets indeed there are which run from all parts of the City, and have moſt of them Arches, but becauſe they are built for Dwelling-houſes for private People, who are not curious in the uniformity of their Buildings, they are neither ſo ſtreight nor ſo broad, nor ſo firmly built as the reſt. In all the Streets ſtand the Houſes of the <hi>Manſebdans</hi> or petty <hi>Omrahs,</hi> Perſons of Judicature, Merchants and others, which are not meanly built. It is certain there are many which are built of Brick or other Stones, and divers of Clay, and cover'd with Straw, yet they are nevertheleſs very convenient, having Gardens and Orchards belonging to them; they are alſo very handſom within, for beſides the good Furniture, the Straw Roofs are ſupported by long, hard, and ſtrong Canes, and the Walls Plaiſter'd and Whitened.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe indifferent fair Houſes, there are abundance of leſſer, which being built of Lome, ſerve for Habitations for the Troopers, and other meaner People belonging to the <hi>Bazar</hi> and the King's Court.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of theſe ſlight Houſes <hi>Dely</hi> is very ſubject to Fire. <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. there were above ſixty thouſand Thatch'd Roofs conſum'd by the Flame, which was the greater, as being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the ſtrong Winds that blow in the Summer, which made it ſo fierce, that it deſtroy'd many Camels and Horſes, there being no time to ſave them, and alſo many of the King's Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, which having never been out of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> were ſo baſhful, that they choſe rather to be burnt than be ſav'd by ſtrange Men.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of theſe ſlight Houſes of Lome, <hi>Dely</hi> cannot be ſaid to be any thing elſe than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Villages joyn'd together, or rather a Camp with Tents, onely erected in a better order, and more convenient than uſuall in the Fields.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the Houſes of the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> they ſtand alſo in moſt parts of the City, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally along the Rivers, and in the Suburbs.</p>
               <p>If a Houſe in theſe warm Countreys bears the Name of Handſom and Large, it is infallibly very convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> it is ſeated in a place where the Wind can come to it from all Corners, eſpecially the Northern: it hath Gardens, Orchards, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, and Springs, large Vaults or Cellars, with great light Holes to let the Wind in at. The Inhabitants retiring into them in the heat of the day, ſtay in them till about four or five a clock;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63517:150"/>or elſe they have <hi>Cascanays,</hi> which are little Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Straw, or ſweet-ſmelling Roots, being very curiouſly made, and commonly plac'd in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Park, near a Pond or Spring, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may with their Leather Jacks wet them on the out ſide.</p>
               <p>The eminent Houſes ſtand in the midſt of a large Square, and have not ſloaping but flat Roofs, on which they may ſleep in the Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Houſes.</note>As to what concerns the inſide of the principal Houſes, the Floors are cover'd with Cotton Quilts of four Fingers thick, with a white Linnen Cloth laid over them in the Summer, and with Carpets in the Winter. In the chief Chambers near the Wall muſt alſo lie two or three Quilts cover'd with Silk, and embroider'd with Gold and Silver, for the Maſter of the Houſe to ſit on, or for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality that come to viſit him: moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, on every Quilt lies a Cuſhion of Cloth of Gold; round about the Chamber againſt the Walls, ſtand alſo many of theſe great Cuſhions of Flannel or flower'd Sattin to ſit on. In the Walls, about four or five Foot from the Floor, they make ſeveral Windows of different faſhions, even one with another, and adorn'd with Flower-pots and <hi>Porcelane</hi> Diſhes; but they have no Images of Men or Beaſts, becauſe their Religion permits it not.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the foremention'd Houſes in <hi>Dely</hi> are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd after one and the ſame manner, though more or leſs rich according to the Quality of the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by which means <hi>Dely</hi> is not without many fair Buildings, yet far inferior to our <hi>European.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Dely</hi> is the Seat and Court of a mighty Prince, and the Staple for many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, yet it is not to be compar'd to <hi>London, Paris,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the richeſt and moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commodities being oftner found in Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes than Shops, for where there is one Shop furniſh'd with fine Cloths, Silk-Stuffs mixt with Gold and Silver, <hi>Turbants</hi> embroider'd with Gold, Cloth of Tiſſue, and other rich Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there are above twenty which fell nothing but Butter, Rice, Barley, Peaſe, Wheat, and other Corn, the common Food not onely of the Heathens, who never eat Fleſh, but alſo of the vulgar <hi>Mahumetans</hi> and Soldidrs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dely</hi> ſtor'd with divers ſorts of Fruit from other Parts.</note>In this City is a moſt excellent Fruit-Market, and many Confectioners Shops, who ih the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſell all ſorts of dry'd Fruit, brought thither from <hi>Perſia, Balk, Bocara,</hi> and <hi>Samarcand,</hi> as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Piſtachoes, Nuts, Raiſins; Plumbs, Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, and others. In the Winter there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grapes, brown and white, which being wrapt up in Cotton, are alſo brought from the foremention'd Countreys, as likewiſe Apples, two or three ſorts of Pears, and rare Melons, which laſting the whole Winter, are ſold very dear.</p>
               <p>There are no Fruits growing in this Countrey but Melons, which being not very good, are ſold at a ſmall rate. Perſons of Quality who take care to have the Seed brought from <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Till or Manure their Ground well, may have excellent good Melons, yet they are very ſcarce, the Earth being ſo barren, that after the firſt year they dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Fruit call'd <hi>Amba</hi> or <hi>Mangas,</hi> which for two Moneths in Summer are very plentiful and cheap.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe all the year round <hi>Patecues,</hi> or Water-Melons.</p>
               <p>Their Preſerves are very ill made, being full of Dirt and Flyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeveral ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in <hi>Dely.</hi>
                  </note>Every Street affords Shops full of Bread, which by reaſon there are but ſew Ovens, is not well prepar'd; yet in the Caſtle is much delicate Bread ſold; and the <hi>Omrahs</hi> alſo make good Bread in their Houſes, not ſparing Milk, Eggs, and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to put into it, yet it commonly taſtes mealy and burnt.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Bazars</hi> are ſeveral Cook Shops where Meat is dreſs'd, but after a ſluttiſh manner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their Meat is very unwholſom, for they commonly roaſt or boyl a piece of a Horſe or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, or of an Ox that dy'd in a Ditch; ſo that all Perſons who will eat good Meat, muſt dreſs it in their own Houſes.</p>
               <p>In moſt parts of the City are Shambles, where Fleſh is expos'd to Sale; but the Buyers muſt take ſpecial care that they buy not Mutton in ſtead of Goats-fleſh, becauſe both their Beef and Mutton is very feaveriſh, windy, and bad to digeſt, though well enough taſted.</p>
               <p>The beſt Victuals in this Countrey is a raw Buck, which is not ſold in Joynts by Butchers, but alive, ſo that if any Perſon hath a mind to it, he muſt buy a whole Buck, which is very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, becauſe the Fleſh, though kill'd in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be tainted before Night.</p>
               <p>They have no Capons in this Countrey, the Inhabitants whereof are more compaſſionate to Beaſts than Men, whom they bereave of their Genitals to ſerve them in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> but in the Market are abundance of Hens, which are cheap and good; and amongſt others there are a ſort of little Hens with black Feathers, which are very dainty, and therefore dear.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Pigeons to be ſold, but no young ones, becauſe they account it criminal to kill them.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Pheaſants, but much ſmaller than ours, which are taken in Nets, and brought alive to the Market, as they do Ducks and other Fowl.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the Fiſh, there are few which love it, notwithſtanding there are ſome very good, eſpeciall two ſorts; the one is call'd <hi>Hinghala,</hi> and the other, reſembling our Carps, is call'd <hi>Rau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Caſtle.</note>The Caſtle, of which we have before made mention, comprehends the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and other Royal Structures; but they reſemble not the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean,</hi> nor need they be like them for it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they have the ſplendor and ſtrength which this Climate requites. There is nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the Entrance, except two great Elephants of Stone, which ſtand on each ſide of the Gate; on the one ſits the Image of <hi>Jemel,</hi> the famous <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Chitor;</hi> on the other, that of <hi>Polta</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two Heroes, who with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more valiant than they, vex'd the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol Ecbar,</hi> and ſhew'd excellent proofs of their Valour in the Towns which he Beſieg'd, reſolving rather to die with their Mother, than become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Mogol.</hi> By reaſon of this unheard of Valour, their Enemies themſelves have thought them worthy to have the two foremetion'd Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues erected in honor of them.</p>
               <p>Having paſs'd through the Gate of the Caſtle, you come to a long broad Street, which is divided into two by a Brook of running Watet, and hath on each ſide a long <hi>Divan</hi> of five or ſix Foot high, and four broad, with ſeveral Arches like Gates.</p>
               <p>On this long <hi>Divan</hi> Scriveners, Regiſters, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63517:151"/>others have their ſeveral Offices out of the Preſs and Crowd of the People which paſs by them along the Street, which lies lower than their Shops, on which alſo the <hi>Manſebdars</hi> or petty <hi>Omrahs</hi> keep Guard in the Night.</p>
               <p>There is a Brook running through the midſt of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which fills other Moats with its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hath its original out of a River three or four Leagues from <hi>Dely,</hi> whence it is convey'd in a Channel croſs the Plains, and between many Rocks, which have been open'd with great difficulty and hard Labor.</p>
               <p>Coming through the other Gate of the Caſtle, there opens another large and broad Street, which alſo hath its <hi>Divans</hi> on each ſide with Shops. This Street being properly a <hi>Bazar,</hi> is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious during the Rainy and Summer Seaſon, becauſe it is covere'd with a long and broad Arch, which on the top hath a fair <hi>Cupula,</hi> through which it receives Light.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two Streets are ſeveral other leſſer on the right and left ſide, which lead to the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where the <hi>Omrahs</hi> watch twenty four hours once a Week by turns. Theſe Lodgings are very ſtately, the <hi>Omrahs</hi> beautifying them at their own Coſts and Charge, and are commonly the great <hi>Divans,</hi> which are oppoſite to a Square, interlac'd with ſeveral Brooks of Water and Springs. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that they are on the Guard, the King ſends them all their Victuals ready dreſs'd, which they receive with great Ceremony and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, repeating three ſeveral times the <hi>Taſlin</hi> or Thanks, and laying their Hands upon their Heads, turn their Faces towards the King's Lodgings.</p>
               <p>There are yet many more <hi>Divans</hi> and Tents erected in ſeveral places, which are the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divers Officers.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are a great number of <hi>Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nays,</hi> which are Shops wherein Handicraftſmen follow ſeveral Employments, as Embroiderers, Goldſmiths, Painters, Taylors, Shoemakers, and Silkweavers, each in a peculiar Shop.</p>
               <p>All theſe Tradeſmen come every Morning to work in this <hi>Carcanays,</hi> and ſtaying there all day, return home to their Houſes in the Evening, each Man living very peaceably and quiet, none aiming to be higher than their Condition hath allotted them; for a Taylor breeds his Son a Taylor, and ſo the reſt, and no Perſon converſes with any Man but thoſe of his own Trade; which Cuſtom is punctually obſerv'd, not onely by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who are oblig'd thereto by their Laws, but alſo amongſt the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> which is the occaſion of many beautiful Virgins living unmarried, when as they might Match to the raiſing their Fortunes, if their Parents would permit them to Marry a Man of another Trade or Quality which they account meaner than theirs.</p>
               <p>After having paſs'd all theſe Places before mention'd, you come to the <hi>Amacas,</hi> which is a large Square with <hi>Piazzaes,</hi> which have no Houſes over them, but are divided by a Wall with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Door or Gate, through which you walk out of one part into another.</p>
               <p>Beyond the great Gate, which is in the midſt of one of the ſides of this Square, you come to a large <hi>Divan,</hi> which is all open towards the ſide of the Court, and is call'd <hi>Nagar-canay,</hi> becauſe it is the place where the Trumpetters, or rather Cymbal-players are, who in their Turns play both day and night. But this ſeems at firſt a ſtrange ſound in the Ears of Strangers who are not us'd to it, there being ſometimes ten or twelve of theſe Trumpetters, and as many Cimbal-players, who play all together.</p>
               <p>They have Trumpets which they call <hi>Carna,</hi> a Cubit and a half long, with an opening at the bottom of a Foot diameter. So likewiſe there are Cymbals of Copper or Iron, half a Yard wide, from whence one may judge of the noiſe which they make; their ſound is ſo harſh in the Ears of Strangers, and ſo loud, that they cannot endure to hear the ſame; yet cuſtom makes it pleaſant, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Night, when it is heard at a diſtance on the tops of Houſes; wherefore thoſe that are appointed to play, are plac'd on high at a diſtance from the King's Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to the great Gate of the Court, over which this <hi>Nagar-canay</hi> is kept, is a ſpacious Hall, built on ſeveral high Columns, and open on three ſides, all which look towards the Court. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Floor of this Hall are gilded and painted. In the midſt of the Wall, which ſeparates this Hall from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> is a very high and broad Window, where the King ſits on his Throne, with ſome of his Sons by his ſide, and ſome Eunuchs ſtanding near him, who either keep the Flyes from him with the Tails of Peacocks, or cool him with great Fans, whilſt others in other poſtures wait to receive his Commands: Below him ſtand all the <hi>Omrahs, Rajas,</hi> and Ambaſſadors, with caſt-down Eyes, and their Hands on their Breaſts: Below theſe ſtand the <hi>Manſebdars,</hi> or inferior <hi>Omrahs,</hi> in the ſame humble poſtures, whilſt the remaining part of the Hall or Court is fill'd with divers ſorts of other People. In this place the King gives Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Perſons every day about Noon; for which reaſon this great Hall is call'd <hi>Amcas,</hi> that is, <hi>The Place of Audience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the foremention'd Aſſembly, the King, to recreate himſelf, cauſes a certain number of his beſt Horſes to be led by before him, that ſo he may ſee whether they are well kept, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth by his beſt Elephants, which are waſh'd and colour'd black all over, except two broad red Stroaks, which running from their Heads croſs their Backs, unite near the Tail.

This Caſtle, which is accounted the beſt and ſtrongeſt Fortreſs, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath in all <hi>India,</hi> except that of <hi>Cabul</hi> and <hi>Candahar,</hi> is commonly fortifi'd with eighteen great Guns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many leſſer, and hath a large ſquare inward Court, in the middle whereof ſtands a high Pole, on which placing an Arrow, they ſhoot at it with a Bowe. The King's Lodgings, which are on the left ſide, at the entrance into this Square, are very low, and none of the moſt beautiful. Under the Windows of theſe Lodgings appear ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers call'd <hi>Manſebdars,</hi> which Command each a thouſand Horſe; and within the Rails under the Penthouſe ſtand two artificial Elephants, colour'd according to the Life. Oppoſite to the King's Lodgings are many other ſuch like Ornaments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the Countrey. The Martial Officers, and thoſe which ſerve in the next Places under the <hi>Manſebdars,</hi> as the <hi>Chans</hi> and others of like Quality, keep Guard on the King's Roofs or Balconies, or in ſome Rooms near them; thoſe that are of a lower Degree, and Command onely over two or three Horſes, walk up and down the Court without the Incloſures. On the other ſide of the foremention'd Lodgings, ſtands another Structure with an Incloſure oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereto, but without any Ornamentals, where the King's Life-guards and other Officers keep Guard. Out of this Court paſſing through a Gate, you come into another Court, which being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Lodging-Rooms and Kitchins, is not ſo neat and clean as the other. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeveral <hi>Caravanſeraes,</hi> and amongſt others one call'd <hi>Terri Caravanſera,</hi> or <hi>The Taylors Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſera.</hi>

               <p>At the end of the great Street <hi>Bazari Colan</hi> ſtands a <hi>Pagode</hi> built in honor of <hi>Mahadeu,</hi> to which a great number of People reſort daily: moreover, the Street which leads thither is always full of People, not onely thoſe that go thither to their Devotion, and thoſe that return from thence, but alſo abundance of poor People, who ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſides of the Street, beg Alms of thoſe that paſs by. The <hi>Pagode,</hi> which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different large Building, hath a long narrow En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try almoſt under Ground, for it goes down with ſeveral Steps, which makes it ſeem to be rather a Way leading into a Cave, than a <hi>Pagode.</hi> By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the abundance of People that flock thither, and the narrowneſs of the Way, there is always a great Crowd: At the Entrance hang ſeveral Bells, which the Pilgrims gingling at their going in, make a continual noiſe with them. In the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gode</hi> are ſeveral <hi>Gioghi</hi> or Prieſts, which go ſtark naked, having onely a Cloth about their Privities;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63517:153"/>they wear long Hair, which they ſeldom or never Combe; they colour their Foreheads with Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, and ſtrew Sand upon them, but keep the other parts of their Body very clean; yet ſome of them painting themſelves with ſeveral Colours, ſprinkle Aſhes over the Painting.</p>

No Man or Woman is permitted to approach this holy Place, unleſs barefoot, and they are to make their Offerings kneeling before the Rail which incloſes the Images. The Offerings conſiſt in all manner of ſweet-ſmelling Flowers. Oyl to burn in the Lamps, and Rice and Salt, which they ſtrew on ſome little Bells that hang amongſt ſeveral Lamps before the Rail; whilſt the Prieſt lays the foremention'd Trifles before the Images, with a great Cloth over his Mouth, that no unclean thing may come from his Breath upon the Image, he mutters many things before it to himſelf, and ſometimes going to the Lamps, holds his Hands a conſiderable time over the Flame, and rubs them as if he waſh'd them with Water, and ſometimes rubs them over his Face, which they affirm ſerves to purifie them, becauſe they ſay that the Fire cleanſes all things.</p>
               <p>Both within and without the City are many pleaſant Gardens and Banquetting-houſes, and in the midſt of them Ponds and Wells of clear and ſweet Water, in which the Inhabitants Bathe themſelves in hot Weather.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of Gardens and Orchards in and about the City, it ſeems to Strangers to be rather a pleaſant Grove than a City. It hath alſo very large and populous Suburbs, and amongſt others one call'd <hi>Begamboer.</hi>

               <p>Eaſtward from the City the <hi>Benjans</hi> have built an Hoſpital, wherein they cure all wounded Birds, Beaſts, and other Animals.</p>
               <p>There are twenty five eminent Villages under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Amadabath,</hi> and under them two thouſand nine hundred ninety eight Hamlets, which pay Tribute to the great Villages.</p>

               <p>The Countrey of <hi>Cambaya</hi> to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> is for the moſt part deſolate and uncultivated. In the Way are ſeveral Pits, each above thirty Yards deep, in which is ſalt Water, though at a great diſtance from the Sea; it is drawn out by Oxen.</p>
               <p>The Countrey about <hi>Amadabath</hi> is nothing but a vaſt Wilderneſs, and the Ways very duſty and troubleſom for Travellers. The High-ways are Hedg'd in on both ſides with a certain Fruitleſs and Leafleſs Plant, which ſhoots forth onely little long Stalks, of a deep Green, both Winter and Summer, out of which, when broke aſunder, drops a milky Juice like that of green Figs, and being very ſharp, eats into that part of the Skin on which it drops. The Fields which border the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, are full of <hi>Ambe</hi>-trees, which bear a Fruit like great Olives, and alſo af <hi>Tamarind</hi>-trees.</p>
               <p>Without the City are many great Tombs of Marble, erected by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and are much ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than their Houſes.</p>

At a certain time of the year, moſt of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> come hither in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, firmly believing thereby to obtain pardon for their ſins. On one ſide of it is a large Pond.</p>
               <p>About a Mile from the City is another fair Tomb, of an eminent <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Merchant call'd <hi>Hajom Majom,</hi> who being enamor'd of the Beauty of his Daughter, and threupon Raviſhing her, was Beheaded by the King's Command, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried here with all his Family; wherefore the Inhabitants to this day call the ſame <hi>Betychint,</hi> that is, <hi>The uncover'd ſhame of your Daughter.</hi>

               <p>There is yet another delightful Garden with a Banquetting-houſe, which was built by the <hi>Great Mogol Ecbar,</hi> in commemoration of his conquering the laſt King of <hi>Zurratte,</hi> call'd <hi>Sultan Mahomed Begeran,</hi> in that very place; whereby the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Zurratte</hi> became ſubject to the <hi>Great Mogol.</hi>

                  <hi>Cambaya</hi> being twice as big as <hi>Surratte,</hi> is two hours walking in circumference, and is ſurrounded with a double Stone Wall, which hath twelve Gates. Its chiefeſt Ornament conſiſts in its great Suburbs. The Streets are ſtreight and broad, and lock'd up every Night with a great pair of Gates. The Houſes are partly of Brick, and partly of Free-ſtone, but all kept very moiſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cool, and would here be accounted but mean Houſes, yet are reckon'd the beſt in the Countrey, being cover'd with Tyles, and having Gutters to receive the Rain-water, which in the three Summer Months falls in great abundance.</p>

                  </note>The Fortreſs, or Rock of <hi>Aſſerim,</hi> lies up ſome Leagues farther into the Countrey, up which they generally climb bare-foot, that ſo they may take the ſurer footing, it being very high, ſteep, and ſlippery, inſomuch that thoſe who aſcend the ſame, are in great danger of falling from the top to the bottom; or elſe if they aſcend on the other ſide, they climb up by Ropes, with which they hoiſe up Cows and other things, which they want. And though this Rock lie between many other, which may eaſily be aſcended, yet it is ſo high above them, that it ſeems to be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs which Commands over the reſt: And as this Place is the Key to all the reſt which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> poſſeſs to the Northward in <hi>India,</hi> ſo it is likewiſe a great Eye-ſore to the neighboring Kings, who have for that reaſon practis'd divers ways to conquer the ſame; which to prevent, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> are continually upon their Guard, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at thoſe Places which yield a good Proſpect. On the top of the ſaid Rock is a large Plain, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with many great Stones, which they throw down upon thoſe that come to invade them. Not onely the Soldiers, but alſo the Inhabitants of the Place watch every Night, and carry Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made of a kind of Wood, like Canes which laſt a long time, and cannot be put out by any Wind or Rain, which rather makes them burn the better. This Place is alſo a Sanctuary for all Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, who repairing thither for ſhelter are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and kept there for Soldiers, which with their Wives and Children amounted formerly to about ſeven hundred. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> conquer'd this Rock in the time of the Governor <hi>Francis Borrero.</hi>

                  </note>The Countrey of <hi>Surratte</hi> is interlac'd by many Rivers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nardabat</hi> which takes its courſe by the City <hi>Brotcha,</hi> and divides it ſelf into two Arms, about four Leagues from the City towards the South near the Village <hi>Hanſoot;</hi> in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is one, and in others two Miles broad, and is divided by many other Streams, which have Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages into the Sea. The Soil is for the moſt part clayie, and mix'd with Sand, except near the City, where it is all Sand; it extends Eaſt North-Eaſt, and Weſt South-Weſt. The other Rivers are <hi>Waſſet</hi> and <hi>Bate,</hi> which laſt ſprings out of the Mountains of <hi>Gate,</hi> and falling into the Gulf of <hi>Bambain,</hi> divides the Kingdom of <hi>Decan,</hi> and Countrey of <hi>Surratte</hi> or <hi>Cambaya.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tapta,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Tyndee</hi> alſo glides between the Countrey of <hi>Surratte</hi> and that of the <hi>Benjans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River <hi>May,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Mehi,</hi> or <hi>Guandari,</hi> along whoſe Banks the City of <hi>Cambaya</hi> is built, is dry at low Ebb, except in three or four places, which having always about four or five Foot of Water, are dangerous to wade through without a good Guide, becauſe of the ſtrong Current that is in them. This River ebbs and flows daily ſeven Fathom perpendicular. At High-water the Ships come to an Anchor cloſe before the City, but are left quite dry at Low-water. The Ground being ſandy, and mix'd with Clay, is much better and eaſier for thoſe Veſſels that lie dry upon it, than if it were hard Sand.</p>
               <p>About a League Southward from <hi>Cambaya</hi> glides the River <hi>Mihi,</hi> whoſe Shore muſt be travell'd at the low Ebb of the Sea, and not without great danger, becauſe the Sea riſing, flows up above five Leagues; and at low Tide you are forc'd to wade through two or three deep places: if any one ſhould venture to wade through at the coming in of the Tide, he would undoubtedly be ſwallow'd by the Sea: for when the Water flows with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength, and higher than ordinary (for it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no Rule, but riſes and falls more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of the Moon,) it carries and waſhes away both Horſe and Man, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſuch force, that an Elephant cannot withſtand the ſame, nor all his weight prevent him from being carried away; wherefore all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers wait for a certain time to wade through the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Sea is low, which is at the new Moon, at which time they may go over it in Coaches or on Horſeback without any danger; Coaches are commonly held faſt on both ſides, that they may not be overturn'd by the Waves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that go on foot ſtrip themſelves naked, and tying up their Clothes, carry them on their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: many times a whole Caravan, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People, travel over the ſame, ſome in Coaches, ſome in Waggons, ſome on Horſeback, and others on foot, both Men and Women ſtark naked, accounting it neither ſhameful nor immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. The Soil between both, <hi>viz.</hi> between the ſaid River and the City <hi>Cambaya,</hi> is firm and hard, and is not overflown, though plain, and not far from the Sea.</p>
               <p>In moſt Places of the Kingdom is excellent Water, except in the City of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> where there is great want of it. There are ſeveral Pools of Water in the Towns, and ſome of them ſo big, that the Inhabitants filling them in the Winter, have enough to ſerve them all the year.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Countreys which lie near the <hi>Indian Sea,</hi> is a certain rainy Seaſon or Winter, <hi>viz.</hi> four Moneths in the year, beginning in <hi>June</hi> when the Sun enters into the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ending in <hi>September:</hi> If it Rains out of the Seaſon, it is unuſual, but betokens a fruitful year; for in the other eight Moneths the Weather is ſo ſerene and clear, that there is ſcarce a Cloud ſeen in the Skie; neither doth it rain conſtantly during the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd four Months, as in <hi>Goa,</hi> but onely ſometimes, eſpecially at the beginning of the New and Full-Moon.</p>
               <p>The Winds blow alſo here ſix Moneths Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, and ſix Months Southerly.</p>
               <p>The Weather is exceeding hot here in <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and very unhealthful, occaſioning Feavers and other Diſtempers, but when it begins to Rain, the Wind blows very ſtrong, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the exceſſive Heat; but in the dry Seaſon, it it hath this inconveniency, <hi>viz.</hi> it draws up the Duſt like a Cloud, and diſperſes the ſame on Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, to their great annoyance.</p>
               <p>In the rainy Seaſon, eſpecially in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> they Till their Lands, and Sowe their Corn, which being, moiſtned by the Rain, produces ſo rich and plentiful a Harveſt, and ſuch abundance of Grain, that all the adjacent Countreys are ſupply'd therewith: for <hi>Surratte</hi> (according to <hi>Linſchot</hi>) is the fruitfulleſt Spot of Land in all <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Countrey produces great quantities of Beans and Wheat, but much bigger and whiter than ours; alſo Barley, Rice, Tares, and Peaſe, which are leſs than thoſe which grow in <hi>Europe;</hi> Linſeed, and a ſmall Seed call'd <hi>Thill,</hi> out of which they preſs abundance of Oyl. There is likewiſe a ſort of Beans or grey Peaſe, which they call <hi>Danna,</hi> growing on little Stalks along the Ground, and ſerving the Horſes in ſtead of Oats.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants Sowe abundance of Muſtard-ſeed and Tobacco, which is much better than that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63517:160"/>of other Places, but they cannot prepare the ſame ſo well as the People in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Countrey.</note>In the Gardens, which are very pleaſant, and near the Towns, grow divers ſorts of Herbs, both for the Pot and Salleting, alſo Raddiſhes, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips. Cucumbers, Garlick, Onions, Beet-roots, Potatoes, and Colworts, beſides eight or ten ſorts of Drugs and little Herbs, as <hi>Turbith, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langa, Spica-nardi, Aſſa Foetida</hi> or <hi>Devils-dung, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
               <p>There is much Cotton, Silk, Sugar, Wax, many Fruit-trees and Plants, as Oranges, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, Lemmons, Limes, Citterns, <hi>Ananas, Bananas,</hi> Figs, <hi>Jackas, Coco</hi>-nuts in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in ſome peculiar Gardens Grapes, though not in very great plenty, and therefore are dearer than other Fruits.</p>
               <p>The Fruit <hi>Mangas</hi> is much better here than in <hi>Ormuz,</hi> but not ſo big, yet of a more delicate ſmell, and having a ſmall Kernel in the middle. They are tranſported to many Places, eſpecially to the Village <hi>Chirches,</hi> two Leagues from the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis <hi>Amadabat,</hi> from whence it hath receiv'd its Name.</p>
               <p>This Countrey hath plenty of Indigo, <hi>Caſſia, Mirobolans, Calamba, Opium</hi> or <hi>Amphion,</hi> two ſorts of Cummin, white and black Ginger, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſerv'd, is ſent to <hi>Perſia</hi> and other Places, as alſo certain Leaves, by the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Tomala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> Tamarinds, and <hi>Palmito</hi>-trees, beſides many other wild Trees not known in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About <hi>Bazaim</hi> grows a Tree which bears the Fruit call'd <hi>Jangomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Countrey near about <hi>Brotcha,</hi> which is very low, and without Mountains, hath many Gardens, planted with <hi>Palmito</hi>-trees, out of which the Natives preſs a Wine in the Countrey Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call'd <hi>Terry</hi> or <hi>Tory,</hi> which is drunk by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The Wine which drops from the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Tree in the Night, is pleaſant and wholſom, but that which drops out of the ſame in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, being ſpoil'd by the Heat, is very hurtful for the Brain: It produces likewiſes plenty of Rice, Wheat, Barley, all ſorts of Rice, and Cotton, but not in ſuch abundance as in <hi>Nederbaer,</hi> and the adjacent Countreys.</p>
               <p>The Mountains of <hi>Pindaetche</hi> are fertile in the production of Corn and other Grain, the Soil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clay mix'd with black Earth.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this Place make little Cheeſes, which are very dry and Salt.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Surratte</hi> are few Date, but many <hi>Coco</hi>-trees found.</p>
               <p>The Trees and Fields are green all the year, but the Graſs in the Summer is ſcorch'd up by the Sun; neither is the Graſs Mow'd here as in <hi>Europe,</hi> but juſt when they have occaſion for it, and as much at a time as may ſerve two or three days.</p>
               <p>The Fields abound with a ſort of Roſes and Roſmary, which have no ſcent; nor have they have above two ſorts of Flowers more all the year, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mogeri,</hi> which is white, and the <hi>Schampi,</hi> which is yellow, both ſmelling very odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferouſly, and worn by Women about their Necks, and ſtrew'd in their Beds.</p>
               <p>The Countrey round about <hi>Brodera</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Villages is very fruitful, and produces Wheat, Barley, Rice, and other Grain, as alſo Cotton in great abundance.</p>
               <p>The whole Coaſt of <hi>Bazaim</hi> hath plenty of Rice, Peaſe, and other Corn, beſides Butter, Oyl, and <hi>Coco</hi>-nuts.</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>Hiacinthes</hi> in this Kingdom, as alſo Diamonds, Pearls, Granads, Topas's, <hi>Corna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, Spinellaes,</hi> and Amethiſts, beſides Alabaſter, red Marble, <hi>Hematites,</hi> or Blood-ſtones, and Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which are but little regarded. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants make green Diſhes of their Jaſpers, and Plates, which reſemble thoſe of <hi>Smerads:</hi> There are likewiſe <hi>Bezoar</hi> Stones, and alſo a Stone by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call'd <hi>Olhos de Gata,</hi> or <hi>Cats-Eyes,</hi> and Agats in great abundance, of which they make curious Hafts of Knives at <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curioſities.</p>
               <p>Abundance of Sealing-wax is made about the Village <hi>Amadabat,</hi> but the greateſt part in the Village of <hi>Sindickera,</hi> eight Leagues Eaſtward from <hi>Brodera,</hi> and in many other Places in <hi>Surratte.</hi> It drops firſt out of ſeveral ſorts of Trees, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Thorn and Plumb-tree. When the Wax is raw, as it drops from the Tree, it is of a dark-brown colour, but being afterwards beaten to Powder, and melted with red, green, or black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, according as they pleaſe, and put on Sticks, it is ſold here in <hi>Europe</hi> to Seal Letters with. They varniſh many Ships therewith, as alſo Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Cabinets, Stools, Bedſteads, and other Wood-woork, which is the occaſion that great quantities thereof are us'd in <hi>Surratte.</hi> The Enamel which they uſe with their Silver and Gold-works, as Hafts of Knives, and the like, they fill up with Wax within, and cover the ſame with Gold ſo neatly, that unleſs a Stranger were inform'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he could not diſcover it from maſſy Gold.</p>
               <p>Near the Village <hi>More,</hi> twenty nine Leagues from the City of <hi>Surratte,</hi> is a Spring, which caſts up boyling hot Water at the foot of a Mountain, out of a hard Rock; a piece of Meat wrapt in Callico, is boyl'd in a ſhort time therein, neither need they put Salt to it, becauſe the Water is Salt, yet of a good taſte, as if <hi>Alants</hi> Roots had been boyl'd therein.</p>
               <p>Six clays Journey from the City <hi>Cambaya,</hi> is a Mountain, which produces <hi>Cornalines</hi> and <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dony;</hi> which laſt the Inhabitants (according to <hi>Barboſa</hi>) call <hi>Bacayores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A League from the City <hi>Brotcha</hi> is another rich Mine of <hi>Chalcedony</hi> and white Agats, which are commonly carry'd to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and not to <hi>Brotcha;</hi> they make abundance of round and oval Diſhes, and other ſmall Veſſels, of the ſame, for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament in their Chambers.</p>
               <p>In moſt Places of <hi>Surratte</hi> are abundance of Oxen, Cowes, Sheep from <hi>Perſia,</hi> with large Tails, Goats, and Buffaloes, which yield good Milk and Butter, and Fleſh which taſtes like Beef, though ſpoil'd by the Heat of the Countrey. The Oxen no way differ from ours, onely they have a Bunch on their Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Between the City of <hi>Amadabat</hi> and <hi>Surrate</hi> are many Goats, Stags, and wild Swine, Geeſe, and other Fowl, in great abundance; the Inhabitants ſeldom kill any of them, eſpecially the <hi>Benjans.</hi> There are alſo many Horſes, not onely of the Breed of the Countrey, but divers others, which being brought out of <hi>Tartary, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> are ſold at a dear rate, becauſe they are accounted the beſt of all <hi>India;</hi> and they not onely take care to provide a Servant for every Horſe, but alſo give them good Provender, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſort of ground and boil'd Beans call'd <hi>Danna,</hi> and both Morning and Evening two pound of Barley Meal, mix'd with a pound and a half of Butter, and a pound of Sugar. They alſo keep many Camels, Mules,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63517:160"/>Rhinocerots, Drommedaries, and Elephants, which are kept by the <hi>Mogol</hi> and Nobility in the Woods.</p>
               <p>There are an innumerable company of wild Beaſts, as Stags, Goats, <hi>Elands,</hi> wild Hogs, Aſſes, whoſe Fleſh the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> eat in ſtead of Lamb, and Hares, which all Perſons are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to catch, except at the time when the King and his Nobles are Hunting; for then it is forbidden on pain of Death.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Woods are alſo the Receſſes for Lyons, Tygers, Leopards (but neither Bears nor Wolves,) mad Dogs, which are call'd <hi>Jekkalla,</hi> abundance of Catamountains, and a Beaſt, which being almoſt like a Ferret, with a Tail like a Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, doth great miſchief to the Fruit, inſomuch that the Husbandmen are forced to watch adays in the Fields when their Corn is ripe, to keep them from ſpoiling it.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe abundance of tame Fowls, as Hens, Cocks, Capons, Peacocks, Geeſe, Ducks, and Crop-Geeſe, which breed near the Rivers or Pools; beſides Partridges, (which are there tame) and Pigeons. The Birds of prey are theſe, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Hawks, Kites, Parrots, and other Birds not known to us in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both within and without the City <hi>Amadabat</hi> are great numbers of Catamountains, which bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Woods, fearleſly frequent the Houſes, and do great damage to thoſe that deal in Fruit, as Dates, Almonds, Figs, Raiſins, and the like; of which they take what they like beſt.</p>
               <p>Between the City <hi>Cambaya</hi> and <hi>Amadabat,</hi> near the Village <hi>Mater,</hi> are abundance of excellent blood-colour'd Squirrels, with curious large Tails; which breeding on Trees, leap nimbly from one to another.</p>
               <p>Many Bats, which are as big as Hens, and have Heads reſembling thoſe of Cats, frequent the Woods, and are by ſome call'd Flying-Cats. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cambaya</hi> and <hi>Amadabat</hi> are likewiſe Bats as big as Ravens.</p>
               <p>There are alſo great numbers of Crows, which flying through the Windows into the Houſes, take the Meat out of the Diſhes without any fear of the People that are preſent: They commonly ſit on the Backs of the Buffaloes, and peck off their Hair; which is the reaſon that moſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Beaſts in theſe Parts are bald: nor have they any other way to free themſelves of the ſaid Fowls, but to run up to their Throats into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs.</p>
               <p>Rats alſo breed here in great abundance, and ſome of them are ſo big that no Cats dare venture to ſeize on them; and oftentimes throw down Houſes, by undermining the Walls and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof: they do likewiſe great miſchief to the Plants and Trees.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are daily much infeſted with Bugs, which filling the Houſes in great ſwarms, ſting the People.</p>
               <p>The Rivers, eſpecially the <hi>Indus</hi> and others, abound with all manner of delicate Fiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Carps, Bremes, Eels, Trouts, Shrimps, and many other <hi>European</hi> Fiſhes, beſides ſuch as are peculiar to thoſe Parts. In the Stream <hi>Indus</hi> breed likewiſe many Crocodiles or <hi>Caimans.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Serpents, and other noxious Creatures.</note>About <hi>Amadabat</hi> are abundance of poyſonous Serpents and Scorpions, which in all parts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> are not alike venomous: for the Sting of a Scorpion on the Iſland of <hi>Great Java,</hi> occaſions great ſwelling, and exceeding pain; but is eaſily cur'd, if Medicines be apply'd thereunto within the ſpace of twelve hours after; but if any one be ſtung by a Scorpion on the Main, he certainly dies within the ſpace of three hours, if he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cut the wounded part till it bleeds, and then anointing it with Oyl of Scorpions, ſear it with a red hot Iron. Moreover the oylie moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which is extracted from the Scorpion which hath ſtung the Party, is alſo an excellent Remedy, if immediately laid on the Wound. The Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſemble in ſhape the Cra-fiſh or Lobſters. Before they are boil'd they have a little round Tail, which erecting it ſelf, reclines backward; at the end thereof is the Sting, which they never draw in, or put out, like other venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but always have the ſame ready to ſting thoſe which approach them: The Sting is very hard, ſharp, and long, like an Iron Hook. The Scorpions, and another ſort of Vermin call'd <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> from its number of Feet, breed for the moſt part on old decay'd Walls.</p>
               <p>There are alſo a ſort of Scorpions with two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> one before, and the other behind the Tail; and it is ſaid that they move one Head one year, and the other another year; and are by ſome in <hi>Greek</hi> call'd' <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies a thing that can go backwards or forwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe two-headed Serpents have occaſioned great Diſputes amongſt the Philoſophers: for ſome, as <hi>Aelianus, Pliny, Lucan, Galen, Nierenbergh.</hi> and <hi>Olearius,</hi> certainly believe that there are really ſuch Serpents: But <hi>Andreas Matthiolus,</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and <hi>John Faber Linceus,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Mexico,</hi> contradicts this Opinion, and looks upon it as a fabulous Tradition, judging this miſtake to proceed from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the forementioned Serpents are as thick at their Tail as at their Head; ſo that there can be no diſtinction made; moreover, that they creep as well back wards as forwards, and have veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Stings in their Tails as well as in their Heads.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Nierenbergh</hi> relates, that an eminent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher call'd <hi>Cortavilla,</hi> had one of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd two-headed Serpents at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Moreover <hi>Geſner,</hi> that a two-headed Serpent was taken in the Sea near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shore.</p>
               <p>This Countrey is alſo exceeding peſter'd with little Piſmires, which are no ſmall annoiance to the Inhabitants, who can ſcarce ſet any Meat out of their Hands, but in a moment ſeveral hundreds crawl upon the ſame; which to prevent, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally keep in their Houſes ſtone Troughs full of Water, in the middle of which laying a great Stone, they lay their Meat upon it, in a Cupboard made for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the many Woods and Trees that are about and near <hi>Amadabat,</hi> there are great plenty of wild Beaſts and Fowls, eſpecially Parrots of all ſorts; ſome whereof are very big, and are by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Europeans</hi> call'd <hi>Indian Ravens;</hi> and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no bigger than Pigeons, are for their ſweet Voices call'd <hi>Cacatu:</hi> They are of a yellowiſh colour, and have a Tuft of Feathers on their Heads: They make their Neſts under the Roofs of Houſes, and are found in great numbers in moſt Towns of all <hi>India.</hi> Others which are leſs, are red and green, and building their Neſts of long withered Graſs, make them faſt to the Boughs of Trees, that ſo they may be freed from Vermin.

This worſhipping of Fire hath its original from one <hi>Zertooſt</hi> their Law-giver, who, as their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63517:162"/>Tradition goes, aſcended to Heaven, and brought down a portion of Fire, which God gave him, together with the Book of their Laws.

They ſay likewiſe, That the Fire which he brought out of Heaven, was a living Fire, which could not be extinguiſh'd by any means, and therefore that it had Divine Worſhip aſcrib'd to it. But it is not certainly believ'd amongſt them, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Fire hath hitherto been preſerved; however, they are permitted to make another Fire of ſeverall Materials, which they are to keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burning, and to worſhip according to the Commands of their Law.</p>

               <p>The worſhipping of this Fire, which the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoor</hi> or <hi>Herbood</hi> (that is the High-Prieſt) keeps ſo carefully, that he never lets the ſame go out, is perform'd in the following manner:</p>
               <p>As often as the <hi>Perſians</hi> meet to worſhip the Fire, the <hi>Diſtoor</hi> or <hi>Herbood</hi> tells them, That the Fire was given from God to <hi>Zertooſt,</hi> as a part of his Power and Glory; and that he had alſo given him a Law which taught him to worſhip the ſame, and was confirm'd by many Miracles; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt eſteem it ſacred and holy, and worſhip and reverence the ſame, as being a part of God himſelf, and of the ſame Eſſence and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with him, or at leaſt differing little from him; that they muſt love all things that reſemble the, as the Sun and Moon, which were made of the ſame, and are two teſtimonies of God, and would come to be Witneſſes againſt them, if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this their Duty, to which they were ſo ſtrictly commanded. Moreover, he admoniſhes them to worſhip God, and beg pardon of him, if accidentally they ſhould ſpill any Water in the foremention'd Element of Fire, which being ſo uſeful for Mankind, might thereby happen to be extinguiſh'd; and not to ſpit in the ſame, or throw any unclean thing into it to make it burn. They therefore keep always Fire in their Houſes, and will never blow out a Candle, Lamp, or any other Light, or quench Fire with Water, though their Houſes ſhould be all in a Flame, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſmother the ſame with Earth; for they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it an ill omen, and a ſign of God's anger, when the Fire in their Houſes chances to go out, and they be forc'd to fetch Fire out of other Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to kindle it again.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The initiation of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>As to what concerns the Initiating of their Children; ſo ſoon as a Child comes into the World, the <hi>Daroo</hi> or Prieſt goes to the Parents Houſe, and having enquired into the Hour and Minute of the Infants Birth, he firſt erects a Scheme, then conſults with the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about naming of the Child; which as ſoon as they have agreed upon, the Mother, in preſence of the whole Company, gives the Child its Name, without any other Ceremony; which done, the Mother and Father taking the Child, follow the <hi>Daroo</hi> to the <hi>Eggaree</hi> or Temple, where the Prieſt takes clear Water, which he ſtirs in the Bark of a certain Tree growing near <hi>Yeſd</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> call'd <hi>Holma,</hi> on which it is affirm'd the Sun never makes any ſhadow, and at laſt taking up a handful of the ſaid Water, ſprinkles the Child therewith, and prays to God that he would cleanſe the Child from his Fathers and Mothers Uncleanneſs: which ſaid, he leaves the Infant with the Parents. When the Child is attain'd to the ſeventh year of its Age, and judg'd fit to be receiv'd and made a Member of their Church, the Parents carry it to the Temple to be inſtructed; where the <hi>Daroo</hi> teaches the Youth ſeveral Prayers, and inſtructs him in his Religion. The Child being perfect herein, repeats all the Prayers which he hath learn'd, over a Fire, with a Cloth ty'd about his Head, which covers his Mouth and Noſtrils, ſo to prevent the Breath which comes out of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Body from blowing upon, and thereby defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the holy Fire. After performance of theſe Prayers, the <hi>Daroo</hi> gives the Child Water to drink, and the Rind of a Pomegranate to chew, thereby to cleanſe it from its inward uncleanneſs: Then they waſh his Body with clean Water, and put him on a <hi>Shuddero,</hi> or Cotton Coat, which reaches down to his Ancles, and alſo give him a Girdle made of Camels Hair, by them call'd <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhee,</hi> which the Youth muſt never leave off. After all this, the <hi>Daroo</hi> ſays this Prayer following:
<q>God grant that you may be a faithful Maintainer, all your Life, of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Religion, of which your Habit is a Efficient Badge; and never believe any other Law but that which <hi>Zertooſt</hi> brought with him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Moreover, that you may always remain conſtant in the worſhipping of the Fire, neither eat the Meat of others, nor drink out of their Cups, but undefil'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Ceremonies and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Perſians.</hi>

               <p>They have five different kinds of Marriage among them, which have each their proper Name:<note place="margin">Their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</note> The firſt, call'd <hi>Shauſan,</hi> is a Marriage of the Son of one Man to the Daughter of another during their Minority, which the Parents manage among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the knowledge of their Children. This ſort of Marrying is highly eſteem'd amongſt them, affirming, That thoſe who are thus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd ſhall undoubtedly go directly to Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Marrying, call'd <hi>Chockerſon,</hi> is when a Widow Marries a ſecond Husband.</p>

               <p>The fourth, nam'd <hi>Ectſan,</hi> is when a Youth or Maid dies, after having been Betrothed, before the conſummation of the Marriage: for in ſuch Caſes they have a Cuſtom to give another Youth or Maid in Marriage to the Deceaſed, becauſe they account Marriage to be a great means to make Men happy in the other World.

As this Opinion is firmly rooted in them, ſo they forget not to meet every Morning, Noon, and Evening, during the ſpace of three days, to implore God to ſhew Mercy to the Soul of the Deceaſed, and to pardon the Sins which he hath committed in his Life-time. After the expiration of the three days, when the Soul hath received her ſentence, then the Relations make a great Feaſt on the fourth day, and ſo end their Mourning.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Twiſt</hi> tells us, That they take the Sick from his Bed, and laying him on the Ground, or a Bed of Sand, let him die there; and about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty days after the Burying of the Dead, they carry the ſaid Bed of Sand, and ſtrew the ſame on his Grave. But <hi>Herbert</hi> ſaith, That they wrap up their deceas'd Bodies in a perfum'd Cloth; and that the Relations which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Corps to the Grave, go beating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet with a profound ſilence, till they come within fifty or a hundred Paces from the Place of Interment, where the <hi>Herboot</hi> at a leſſer diſtance from the Grave expects them, having a yellow Cloth wrapp'd about his Body, and a little Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant on his Head. The Bearers carry the Corps to a little Houſe built like an Oven, where they perform certain ancient Ceremonies; which done, they draw the Body up to the top of a round Stone Building, of twelve Foot high, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four in Circumference, with a double Entrance on the North-Eaſt ſide, conſiſting of two Holes, through which they put the Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that have lived well, through the one; and the wicked, through the other.</p>
               <p>This Structure is flat on the top, and paved with white Clay, which, when dry, is very hard and ſmooth, like Plaſtering: In the middle there is left an open Hole, into which fall the Bones of the Deceaſed, who are laid naked in two Rows on this Structure, in the heat of the Sun, and ſerve for Food for the Fowls of the Air, which in great numbers coming thither, tear and disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the Bodies after a horrid manner: And the Air round about this Place is in the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſo infected with the ſmell of the corrupted Carcaſſes, which often lie to the number of three or four hundred on the top of the forementioned Place, that it often occaſions great Sickneſſes eſpecially in Strangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twist</hi> affirms, That theſe Burying Places are a League or more From the Towns or Villages to which they belong, and being built of Stone, are about three Fathom high, with a Hole in the middle, over which the Deceaſed are laid for the Fowls to devour; and their Fleſh being conſum'd, their Bones fall through an Iron Grate into the foremention'd Hole or Pit. Theſe kind of Grave are of three ſeveral ſorts; one for Men, another for Women, and the third for Children.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide of the City <hi>Surrat,</hi> beyond the great Pool of Water before deſcrib'd, and about a Bowe-ſhoot beyond the great Prince Garden, the <hi>Perſians</hi> have three round Stone Towers, about a Piſtol-ſhot from each other, and about three Fathom high, where they alſo diſpoſe of their Dead. In each of theſe Towers is a Door or Entrance about ſix Foot from the Ground, through which they draw the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies up to the top, which are made flat, and ſo as that the Corps may lie round in three Rows, in Troughs or Cheſts of about half a Foot deep.</p>
               <p>They account the Bodies of Men to be much more unclean than thoſe of Beaſts, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Bones of them; for they will by no means touch the Bones of a dead Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And if any ſhould chance accidentally to touch them with their Clothes, they are oblig'd immediately to put them off, and all things they have on, and throw them away, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; and after having waſh'd their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to put on others, and ſtay within nine days, without driving any Trade, or ſo much as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wives or Children. Moreover, they account all thoſe Perſons damn'd, whoſe Bones after their deceaſe happen to fall into the Water, and believe, That the Souls of ſuch have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many hainous Sins whilſt living upon Earth.</p>

               <p>The People are very Charitable, being much inclin'd to the giving of Almes to the Poor, very Pious, and ſollicitous of their Salvation, though deluded by their Teachers; ſome giving twenty five, others fifty Ducats at a time, and ſome more. <hi>Peruſhi</hi> affirms. That <hi>Anno</hi> 1595. there was on one day, <hi>viz.</hi> the eighth of <hi>January,</hi> above a Tun of Gold given in Alms. The reaſon of this great Charity on that day, is upon the account of ſome grand Tradition mentioned in their Law-book.

               <p>Out of the City <hi>Cambaya,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peruſchi,</hi> go many Heathens in Pilgrimage to the River <hi>Ganges</hi> in <hi>Bengala,</hi> ſometimes to the number of forty or fifty thouſand, all thoſe accounting themſelves happy that have been bath'd in the foremention'd Stream; and they certainly believe they ſhall be ſav'd, if on their Death-beds they can but get ſome of the Water of the <hi>Ganges</hi> to drink.</p>

The moſt convenient means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to attain to this his deſire, was to Create the World, and all the Creatures which are in the ſame. And in order hereunto, he firſt made the World, beginning with the four Elements, which were to be the Foundation thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth, Air, Water, and Fire; which in the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mix'd together, were ſeparated after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Firſt he blew on the Water with a large <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batane,</hi> or the like Inſtrument, which thereupon bubling up, came to be a great Body in the form of an Egg, which by degrees extending, became the light and clear ſhining Firmament of Heaven, which ſurrounds the whole World. This ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being made, the Earth remained mix'd with a Matter like Sediment of Water, of which God afterwards made a round Ball, and call'd the Lower World, of which the firmeſt part became Earth, and the other, being the weakeſt, the Sea; both which making the exact Figure of a Globe, God plac'd the ſame in the midſt of the Firmament which ſurrounds the Sea and Earth.</p>
               <p>After this, God Created a Sun and Moon, which he placed in the Firmament, to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the Times and Seaſons. And by this means the four Elements, which before were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly mix'd together, were ſeparated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd, and each confin'd to its proper place.</p>
               <p>The Elements thus ſetled, each perform'd its Office: The Air fill'd all things that were empty; the Fire by its Heat gave warmth to all; and the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63517:164"/>Earth and Sea produc'd their ſeveral Creatures, God giving a generative Power to all to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and increaſe, according to their ſeveral kinds. And thus the great World being perfected, was divided into four Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South. This World was to laſt four Ages, and to be inhabited by divers ſorts of People, which were to be produc'd from four Men and four Women, as we will inſtantly relate.</p>
               <p>God having thus created the World and the Creatures, he proceeded to create Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commanded the Earth to produce that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creature out of its Bowels: Firſt it put forth the Head, and ſoon after all the other Parts; into which God breathing Life, the Lips grew red, the Eye-lids open'd, and made two ſparkling Stars to appear; the other Parts of the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move, and his Senſes with Wiſdom, knew their Creator and worſhipp'd him. And becauſe this Creature (which was made for Society) ſhould not be alone, God gave him a Woman for his Companion, which reſembled him as well in his Senſe, Reaſon, and Spirit. This firſt Creature was call'd <hi>Pourus,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Parkoute;</hi> they liv'd together like Man and Wife, and fed upon the Fruit of the Earth, without killing any living Creature. Theſe two Perſons living thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, begat four Sous; the firſt whereof was call'd <hi>Brammon,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Kutterey,</hi> the third <hi>Schuddery,</hi> and the fourth <hi>Wyſe.</hi> Theſe four Brothers were of different Conſtitutions, the four Elements gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to each a different Temper: <hi>Brammon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving participated of the Earth, was Melancholly; <hi>Kutterey</hi> being hot of Temper, had a Warlike Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>Schuddery</hi> being of a cold moiſt Conſtitution, was of a meek Spirit; and <hi>Wyſe</hi> being of an angry Diſpoſition, had a quick Wit.</p>
               <p>Moreover, God endu'd <hi>Brammon,</hi> according to his Nature, with Wiſdom, and through him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd his Laws and Commandments; for he judg'd his reſerv'd Life and ſerious Countenance moſt fit for that purpoſe: and therefore he gave him a Book, wherein was ſet down how he would be ſerv'd; and which alſo treated of other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion.</p>
               <p>God alſo, according to the Conſtitution of <hi>Kut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey,</hi> gave him Power to rule Kingdoms, with a Scepter to keep the People in awe, and make the Commonalty work and labor for the Publick Good: And as a ſign of this Power, God gave him a Sword in his Hand, the proper Inſtrument of his Victory and Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schuddery,</hi> according to his natural Inclinations, God judg'd fit for Traffick, whereby he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all parts of the Earth with ſuch things as they ſtood in need of, by means of Navigation: and as a Token of what he was appointed for, as alſo to mind him of his Employment, God gave him a pair of Scales, with a Bag full of all ſorts of Weights, as proper Inſtruments of his Calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe,</hi> according to his Diſpoſition, God endu'd with a Genius of inventing all manner of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Arts, giving him a Bag full of Tools and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, for the working of ſuch things withal as his Fancy ſhould direct.</p>
               <p>The World being thus far compleated, God gave not <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parkoutee</hi> any Daughters, leſt Works, which hitherto he had preſerv'd from all Uncleanneſs, might be defil'd by the inceſtuous Conjunction of the Brothers with the Siſters; wherefore God being willing to preſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Holineſs of their firſt Parents, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olv'd to ordain ſuch means for the propagating. Mankind, as might correſpond with the Work of the Creation, by making four Women for the Sons of <hi>Pourous</hi> anſt <hi>Parkoutee;</hi> whereof one was ſent to the Eaſt, another to the Weſt, a third to the North, and a fourth to the South, that being thus ſeparated one from the other, the Propagation of Man kind might be the ſooner compleated in all Parts of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The eldeſt Son of the firſt Man call'd <hi>Brammon,</hi> became Great, being highly eſteem'd by his other Brothers, as well for his Age as his great Merits, but eſpecially for the Converſe he often held with God, concerning Religion and the manner of Worſhip; wherein he inſtructed his Brethren, reading the Book which was given him by God, containing the Secrets and Manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, with great Care and Reverence, God revealing himſelf to him very often in Perſon.</p>
               <p>And as God had created Man in a pleaſant and delightful Place, ſituate in the Belly and Navel of the Earth, where the Sun makes no Shadow at Noon, ſo he reſolv'd to ſend the Brothers which were come from the Centre of the World, to the Circumference thereof, to People it. Wherefore he commanded <hi>Brammon</hi> to take the Book wherein were written the Laws of God, and travel towards the riſing of the Sun; who thereupon ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the next Morning, after having travell'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miles, found himſelf near an high Mountain incloſing a pleaſant Valley, which was water'd by a delightful Stream; on whoſe Banks appear'd a beautiful Woman, who came to quench her Thirſt with the Waters; ſhe, like <hi>Brammon,</hi> was ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which their Innocency made them ignorant of. This Woman having black Hair, was of an Olive colour, her Body well ſhap'd, of a middle Stature, ſweet Countenance, and, like him, of a melancholy Diſpoſition. She, ſurpriz'd at the ſight of <hi>Brammon,</hi> was exceedingly amaz'd, not being able for a conſiderable time to ſpeak a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> word, doubtful whether ſhe had beſt run away, or ſtay and ſatisfie her Curioſity with the pleaſantneſs of ſo ſtrange and unuſual an Object; whilſt <hi>Brammon</hi> on his part was no leſs concern'd, fearing if ſhe fled, he ſhould loſe the Preſence of a Creature he ſo extremely admir'd; ſo that they both remain'd ſilent, entertaining mutual Paſſions and Affections the one for the other: At laſt, the Woman having in vain expected an Addreſs from <hi>Brammon,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd her ſelf to him, demanding the reaſon that mov'd him to come thither? who anſwer'd, That it was in obedience to the Command of Him who made the World, and created her and him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all viſible things, as alſo that Light which afforded them the Pleaſure of beholding each other. The Woman, whom God had endu'd a with Wiſdom and Underſtanding, reply'd, That the reſemblance which was between them, was an infallible ſign that they were both made by one Hand, and that the Creator who had ordain'd all things for their Welfare, had certainly appointed their meeting there, that by a nearer Obligation they might for the future be joyn'd together; when caſting her Eyes on the Book which <hi>Brammon</hi> held in his Hand, ſhe ask'd what it was? who in few words diſcovering to her the Contents thereof, ſhe requeſted he would ſit down by her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct her in his Religion; which he willingly granted: when judging that their Meeting was decreed by God, they conſulted the Book, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to unite themſelves by a Matrimonial Vow:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63517:165"/>in order whereto, performing the Ceremonies uſual between Man and Wife, they liv'd in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Unity, and ſo encreas'd the World, that the Off-ſpring of this <hi>Bramman</hi> and <hi>Savatree</hi> (for ſuch was the Name of the Woman) Peopled all the Eaſtern Parts of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>God alſo commanded <hi>Kuttery,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to direct his Courſe Weſtward, in order to the Peopling that part of the World: Who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taking his Sword which God had given him as an Inſtrument to Conquer withal, thought on nothing more than a Conveniency to exerciſe Valor.</p>
               <p>During his Journey, turning his Back every Morning toward the Riſing Sun, to his great amazement he ſaw the ſame every Evening, after having finiſh'd his Journey, a vaſt way before him. Thus Travelling towards the Weſt, he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look'd about him, expecting ſome Adventure would preſent it ſelf, and wiſhing to meet with whole Regiments of Armed Men, or Herds of Wild Beaſts; when nothing appearing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering on what account God ſent him thither, full of Heroick Paſſion, he could not refrain thus to expoſtulate: <hi>For what reaſon has God given me Strength, ſince he denies me an Opportunity to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the ſame, and acquire Honor thereby!</hi> Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he Travell'd yet farther Weſtward, in hopes of meeting an Adventure befitting his Quality, and reſolving to expoſe whatever he ſhould meet, to the Fury of his Rage: When coming to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whoſe Summit yielded a delightful Proſpect over all the adjacent Country, he perceiv'd a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Creature make towards him, of a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Countenance ſutable to his, wherewith he was exceedingly pleas'd; when coming neer together, with an intention of trying each others Valor, he perceiv'd it was a Woman; her Hair diſhevell'd hung dangling over her Shoulders, holding in her Hands a <hi>Chucherey,</hi> which being a round ſharp Weapon, hath a Hole in the middle, through which paſſes a Rope, whoſe end being held faſt in the Hand, does great Execution at a conſiderable diſtance, when thrown at an Enemy: Which he perceiving, immediately believ'd her Valiant; for her enrag'd Countenance was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Teſtimony of the earneſt deſire ſhe had to Conquer and Triumph over her Enemies. After their firſt Aſſault, <hi>Toddikaſtre</hi> (ſo the Woman was call'd) uſing her <hi>Chucherey</hi> with great dexterity, ſoon made <hi>Kuttery</hi> ſenſible of her high diſpleaſure, manifeſting a greater deſire of conquering him with her Arms than with her Beauty; whereby this firſt day of their Meeting was ſpent in Blows and Wounds interchangeably given; ſhe with her <hi>Chuchery,</hi> and he with his Sword, ſcarce allowing each other reſpite to breathe, continuing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate till the dark Night's approach forc'd a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, when neither could boaſt of any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage gain'd upon the other.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, ſo ſoon as the Sun began to dart out his Reſplendent Rays, they renew'd their Combat with freſh Courage and Eagerneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to revenge the Injuries they had receiv'd the day before: Long was the Fight, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when <hi>Kuttery</hi> getting ſome Advantage, cut her <hi>Chuchery</hi> aſunder with his Sword; but it growing dark, <hi>Toddikaſtre</hi> vaniſh'd from <hi>Kuttery,</hi> thereby gaining time to ſupply her ſelf with a Bow and Arrows, and gather new Force to engage an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that had endeavor'd to kill her.</p>
               <p>The third Morning they renew'd the Fight again, entertaining alike hopes of ending the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſpeedily, and ſubduing each other; when ſhe obſerving her Enemy within reach of her Bow, approach'd with great Courage: Which <hi>Kuttery</hi> perceiving, and knowing his Sword would ſignifie little againſt a VVeapon that could command at ſo great a diſtance, reſolv'd to engage her Hand to Hand; when each of them gave ſuch ample Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of their Valor, and ſo wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they remain'd equally Conquerors and Conquer'd. Thus the Fight having been maintain'd on equal Terms, and the Advantage not determinable, they diſputed the Victory with their Tongues, ſince it could not be decided by their VVeapons: For <hi>Kuttery</hi> holding <hi>Toddikaſtre</hi> by the Hair, and endeavoring to make her ſubmit, was extremely ſtruck with admiration when ſhe appear'd to him much more Beautiful than before, as if this Exerciſe had ſerv'd only to encreaſe her Beauty, and render her more amiable; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd him to direct the following Diſcourſe to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore, O Wonder of all Living Creatures, as well for Valor as Beauty, has Fury and Rage thus tranſported us one againſt the other? If I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd you of Life in this Conflict, I ſhould have curs'd my Right Hand for being the Inſtrument of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſo Incomparable a Creature; whereas if you had kill'd me, you could not but have been perpetually troubled in Mind, having bereft your ſelf of the Pleaſures, Enjoyments, and Satisfaction you may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have in my Company: Why then ſhould a Perſon of ſuch Excellency ſeek the Ruin of another, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, would not in the leaſt add to your Luſtre. Hath God given us Underſtanding and Courage to deſtroy one another, eſpecially we that ought to be preſerv'd? Certainly your Valor will not be abated, when I ſhall declare unto you my Condition, and divide my Strength and Power with you; nay rather, being Friends, we ſhall be capacitated for the Undertaking the greateſt Enterprizes whatſoever, and valiantly revenge all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that ſhall be offer'd us. Know then, That the World is yet but like a young Child, having far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er need of being repleniſh'd with People, than bereft of them by force of Arms. Love and Nature teach us to ſtudy our own Preſervation, which may better be accompliſh'd by being at Union, than at Variance one with another. Let us not therefore endeavor by force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unlawful Means to ſeek a Glory which may prove Mortal to both; but let us rather ſtudy to ſettle a happy and everlaſting Peace between us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toddikaſtre</hi> having with great attention heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto a Propoſal grounded on ſo much Reaſon, after a little ſilence reply'd, <hi>That notwithſtanding ſhe plainly diſcover'd ſufficient marks of his Rage and Fury, which might provoke her to Revenge, yet ſhe ſubmitted to his Argument, readily and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to his Propoſal of Peace.</hi> VVhereupon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each other their Hands, to confirm their new Friendſhip, they, of mortal Enemies, became the greateſt Friends in Nature; and reſolving to live and die together, begat many Children, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a Race of Valiant and Heroick Spirits: And thus was the VVeſtern Part of the World Peopled by theſe two Generous Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shuddery</hi> the third Son of <hi>Pourous</hi> was ſent Northward to Traffique as a Merchant, taking with him his Weights and a Pair of Scales, wherewith to weigh whatever was bought or ſold. Having travell'd a conſiderable way, wiſhing to meet with an Adventure ſutable to his Calling, he came at laſt to a Mountain call'd <hi>Challa,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to Rain very hard, he was neceſſitated to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63517:165"/>ſeek for ſhelter in a ſmall Cave which was in the ſaid Mountain. The Rain ceaſing, the Sky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to clear up; but the Water having cover'd moſt of the Ways, kept <hi>Shuddery</hi> from Travelling that day: But no ſooner had the thirſty Earth drunk up the Water, and the Sun dry'd up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Moiſture, when in order to proceed on his Journey he leaves the Cave, and ſcarcely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the bottom of the Valley, but he found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shells, which out of Curioſity opening, he concluded by their Brightneſs and Beauty that they ought carefully to be preſerv'd, though alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of the Value; ſo putting them up very ſafe, he went on, and having ſcarce paſs'd through the Valley, he found himſelf near ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mountain, upon which appear'd a Rock of Diamonds, wich having been waſh'd by the great Rain, appear'd very glorious and ſparkling, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a great admiration in <hi>Shuddery,</hi> who judg'd it to have been a great Fire. Paſſing on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſuppos'd Fire did not ſpread it ſelf, yet encreas'd in Luſtre, he was curious to be ſatisfied what it might be, by touching the ſame with his Finger, whereby he perceiv'd that though theſe glittering Diamonds ſparkled like Fire, yet they had not that Heat with them; wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to expect the next Morning, to ſee if he could make any further Diſcovery of this great Myſtery: But the Day caus'd a far greater altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than he expected, which no ſooner appear'd, but the Light of the Diamonds vaniſh'd, nothing remaining but a Rock of whitiſh Stones, of which he took as many as he could carry, carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Place againſt his Return, in caſe he ſhould be better inform'd of the Value. Whence proceeding, he at laſt eſpy'd the Nymph that was ordain'd for him, walking by the ſide of the Wood which border'd on the Plain he was croſſing: He directed his Courſe towards the Object which at that diſtance appear'd to him moſt pleaſing and beautiful. The Nymph was not a little ſurpris'd at the ſight of him, remaining in ſuſpence whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fly or ſtay, till <hi>Shuddery</hi> approaching near her, thus expreſs'd himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt admirable and beautiful Creature, ſo nearly reſembling me, I beg your Company, not onely for the likeneſs between us, to our mutual admiration, which I hope may oblige you to love me, and entertain a good Opinion of one that follows you with no bad Intent; but that I may be happy in your Converſation, ſince the Similitude between us ſeems to challenge a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Familiarity. Viſagondah</hi> (for ſuch was her Name) expreſs'd by her ſilence the pleaſure ſhe took in <hi>Shuddery</hi>'s Preſence, no way diſtruſting her Safety; at laſt ſhe demanded of him <hi>how it came to paſs that two Perſons, having never ſeen one another before, could ſo perfectly underſtand each others Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi> To which <hi>Shuddery</hi> reply'd, <hi>That God who had given their Bodies a like Shape, had alſo endued them with one Tongue, thereby to aſſiſt and diſcover their Secrets one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſhew'd great Teſtimonies of Friendſhip to one another, ſtaying ſome time in the Place, <hi>Shuddery</hi> related to her his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; after which, living many Years together, they begat divers Children, which grown up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Merchants, with whom <hi>Shuddery</hi> work'd in the Diamond-Rock he had diſcover'd, laying up great Quantities thereof, and prizing them at a high Value, made them ſo eſteem'd of through the whole World. And from the Iſſue of this <hi>Shuddery</hi> (according to the Tradition of the <hi>Indians</hi>) the Northern Parts of the World were Peopled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe,</hi> the youngeſt of the four Brothers, took his Journey towards the South, taking with him the moſt uſeful Inſtruments which he had invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Benefit of Mankind; for God had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd him with far more Underſtanding than any of his Brothers: He was the Inventor of all Arts, and taught his Children to Build Houſes, Towns, and Caſtles, to Till the Groud, and all other things neceſſary to Humane Life; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was call'd <hi>Viskarmah,</hi> that is, <hi>A Vertuoſo,</hi> becauſe nothing was difficult to him that could be done.</p>
               <p>Being endu'd with this great Knowledge and Skill in Husbandry and Building, God order'd him to Travel Southward, where in his way he paſs'd by ſeven great Lakes, leaving at each of them Marks of his Ingenuity; and having paſs'd the laſt, he found himſelf in a Country call'd <hi>Derpe,</hi> where he built a fair Houſe near the Lake, with many Apartments, and a flat Roof. Here he ſtaid ſome time alone to refreſh himſelf; but he had not long enjoy'd the ſweetneſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he was diſturb'd by a ſtrange Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: The Woman which was appointed for him, paſſing by a neighboring Wood near the ſide of the Lake, ſtood ſtill to admire the Magnificent Form of the new-built Structure, which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd to view more narrowly, having never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe</hi> eſpying her ſo earneſtly view his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, found himſelf ſtruck with admiration at the ſight of ſo ſurpriſing a Creature, her Body being perfectly White, and her Hair reſembling the Colour of Gold; wherefore he approach'd nearer the Perſon who at a diſtance had wrought a very great alteration in him: whilſt ſhe was not a little abaſh'd to ſee him come ſo near her, and ask'd the Reaſon of his coming to diſturb her in a Place where ſhe us'd always to be alone. Whereupon <hi>Wyſe</hi> replying, ſaid, <hi>God the Maker of Light, who hath created all things viſible, hath ſent me hither to behold and admire your Beauty, which is ſo excellent, that it ought not to be kept ſecret; for God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to be ſeen, and to teſtifie the wondrous Works of his Hands. And to enjoy your preſence I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd through many Dangers, often adventuring my Life in the ſearch of you; and therefore I hope my Love will meet with a ſutable Return.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd her to afford him the enjoyment of her Company, and to look upon him as the onely Comfort ſent by God in her ſolitary Life.</hi> But ſhe reſolving not to change her manner of Life, reply'd, <hi>That during his Abſence ſhe could no way perceive that his Preſence could be any Advantage to her; nor at that inſtant, whilſt he was talking with her, ſhe could not find her ſelf any ways inclined to receive his Proffers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe</hi> fearing to loſe her Preſence, being deſirous of a longer enjoyment of her Company, requeſted her to walk into his Houſe, and to view the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apartments thereof, hoping when ſhe had ſeen the wonderful Work of his Hands, ſhe would have a greater Reſpect for him: But his Civility ſeem'd rather troubleſom to her, telling him, <hi>That if he would not let her depart freely, he would highly incur her diſpleaſure, and force her to vow never to ſee him more.</hi> Whereupon going from him, ſhe gave him ſufficient Teſtimonies of her Diſpleaſure, and that ſhe was not to be compell'd to do any thing by force. This reduc'd <hi>Wyſe</hi> almoſt into Deſpair, who durſt not by any means prevent her going away, but was compell'd to ſuffer himſelf to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63517:166"/>bereav'd of all thoſe Enjoyments he was poſſeſt of during her ſtay; and having ſpent the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Night in condoling his Misfortune in the loſs of the Perſon he eſteem'd above his own Life, he at break of day concluded to uſe all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to find her again; and croſſing the neighbor Places backward and forward, he at laſt came into a Valley, where he ſpy'd her picking of Flowers, and accoſting her, began as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O moſt Beautiful Creature, much more ſweet and excellent than all the Flowers this Earth produces, the Love which I bear to you forces me a ſecond time to view your moſt incomparable Beauty, and to implore a Return of your Affections. Oh fly not, ſince you have have had ſufficient Teſtimonies of the reality of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> He ſeeing that theſe words had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with her to ſtay, began to diſcourſe with her concerning the Creation of the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of what Parents he was extracted, and after what manner his Brothers were ſent into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the Earth: And after many other remarkable Paſſages, he told her, he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God would have permitted him to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel over ſeven Seas, and undergo ſo many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, had not his Reſolutions been to ſweeten the toilſomneſs of his Lahors and Troubles by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Enjoyment of her Company. She not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in his Diſcourſe, deſir'd him to entertain ſome other things in his Thoughts; and if he could give her no greater Teſtimonies of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to leave her alone, and not trouble her more with any ſuch Diſcourſe: And ſo they parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe</hi> thus depriv'd of all his Enjoyments and Happineſs, being extremely perplex'd in Mind, went into a ſolitary Place, where falling down on his Knees, in a doleful Tone he utter'd theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, to whom only belongs the Knowledge of my Being, thou knowſt that in obedience to thy Commands I have forſaken the Company of my Parents, and alſo that of my Brothers, and perhaps I ſhall never ſee them more: Thou alſo knoweſt that I have endur'd great hardſhip during the time of my Travels, and deſerted all Company, to range up and down the World alone: But that which moſt perplexes me, is the ſight of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, in ſtead of comforting me with her Preſence and Converſation, adds to my Grief, by denying me her Company. O Lord, do not reward all my Troubles ſo ill, and deſtroy not all thoſe good Parts thou haſt given me, by this great Misfortune. And you blue Heavens, and green Trees, under which I kneel, be Witneſſes of my Misfortune; and therefore, O thou Creator of all things, if thou haſt the leaſt kindneſs for thy Creature, give me, I beſeech thee, a ſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by comforting me in this unſufferable Affliction under which thy Servant groans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner had he ended his Prayers, but a ſweet Brieze of Wind came ruſhing through the Leaves of the Trees, which was follow'd by a Voice, ſaying, <hi>What are thy Demands, O Son of Pourous?</hi> To which he anſwer'd, <hi>That I may enjoy the Woman whoſe Face I ſo lately beheld, and that we may be united by the inſeparable Bond of Matrimony, that ſo I may enjoy the ſweetneſs of her Company till the Hour of my Death.</hi> This was immediately granted him, upon condition that he ſhould build <hi>Pagods</hi> or Temples under the Shades of Trees, there to ſerve God, and worſhip the Images, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had heard his Prayer. Immediately after <hi>Jejunogundah</hi> (for ſo the Woman was call'd) finding her ſelf inclin'd to love <hi>Wyſe,</hi> went and gave him Teſtimony of her Affections, granting him all his Wiſhes; ſo that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward living quiet in the mutual Enjoyment of each other, they begat many Children: By which means the Southern, as well as the other Parts of he World, came to be Peopled.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Theſe four Brethren, after having thus Peopled the World, reſolv'd to return again to the Place where they firſt receiv'd Life. <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was the firſt who with his Extract, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Planted the Eaſt, reſolv'd to go and end the remaining part of his Days in the Place where he was born, and there to inſtruct his People in the true Worſhip of God, to the end there might be onely one way of Serving God throughout the whole VVorld, which otherwiſe might breed a great diſtraction among the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kuttery,</hi> who was the ſecond Brother, and the firſt who had compleated his Journey after <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and perform'd all things he was deſign'd for, had alſo an Inclination to ſee his Native Country, to acquaint his Parents and Brothers with the Bleſſing that God had beſtow'd upon him, in a VVife and ſo many Children; and alſo to relate to them the Adventures he had met withal during his abſence.</p>
               <p>The ſame Reaſons mov'd <hi>Shuddery</hi> and <hi>Wyſe</hi> to Travel to their Native Country. Moreover, God, who would not fruſtrate their Deſigns by any ill Accidents that otherwiſe might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſuffer'd them all ſafely to meet at one Place, after every one of them had perform'd thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were enjoyn'd them, to the great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Joy of their Parents and themſelves; and began, like Men remov'd to a new Plantation, to propagate their Generations at home alſo, to the end the World might be fully Peopled in all Parts, ſpending their time in teaching their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeveral Arts. <hi>Brammon</hi> inſtructed them in Religion, <hi>Kuttery</hi> in Matters of State, <hi>Shuddery</hi> in Merchandiſe, and <hi>Wyſe</hi> in Mechanicks: So that at this time the VVorld conſiſted of theſe four ſorts of People, each Tribe living apart, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Office, for avoiding all Confuſions and Diſorders: And thus the VVorld was Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each Part, and all thing were for a time in good Order. But their Joy did not long continue, they having no ſooner taſted the ſweetneſs of it, than it vaniſh'd; for as <hi>Multitude is the Mother of Confuſion,</hi> and occaſions much Miſchief, and many Evils happen where the People are numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and careleſs, and Negligence reigns chiefly in proſperous Times; ſo by the Senſuality of theſe four Brethren forgetting all thoughts of their preſent and former Happineſs, all things began to run into miſerable Confuſion, becauſe the People were too much enclin'd to Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Eaſe; <hi>Brammon</hi> neglecting his Duty and Religion, and Service of God: <hi>Kuttery</hi> became a Tyrant: <hi>Shuddery</hi> falſified his VVeights and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and practis'd all manner of Knavery to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Brothers: <hi>Wyſe</hi> grew unconſcionable, employing the Benefits which aroſe from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in Profuſeneſs. Thus each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating from their firſt Principles, grew malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to each other; <hi>Brammon</hi> not being able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with the Inſolence of his Brother <hi>Kuttery,</hi> who on the other ſide refus'd to ſhew Reverence to <hi>Brammon,</hi> which he was oblig'd to, as being his elder Brother; moreover, he was very cruel, and took delght in putting to death thoſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd, forc'd <hi>Shuddery</hi> to pay Tribute to him, and reap'd the benefit of <hi>Wyſe</hi>'s Lahor. Theſe bad
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63517:166"/>Examples were the firſt Seeds of Wickedneſs, which encreas'd to a greater height amongſt their Succeſſors, and made a breach of the ſweet Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which reign'd at that time in the firſt Age of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyſe</hi> ſeeing <hi>Brammon</hi> love his Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which was due to him, concluded to make him yet more miſerable, by inſtituting a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Religion in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping or Images, which he was commanded by a Viſion; hereupon he built <hi>Pagods</hi> under the Shades of Trees, ordaining many new Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: But becauſe there was no mention made of them in the Books of <hi>Brammon,</hi> great Diſputes were held for a long time to know whether they ſhould be receiv'd or not; but after <hi>Wyſe</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that he had receiv'd them from the Mouth of God, they were adjudg'd Lawful. Moreover, they inventing new and wicked Deſigns daily, and thereby encreaſing their Sins, God was diſpleas'd thereat, the Heavens were cover'd with Horror and Darkneſs, the Sea ſwell'd with Anger, as if it would unite with the Clouds to ruin the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a great Noiſe was heard in the Air, Thunder and Lightning aroſe from the Center of the Earth, as if it threatned to purge the World from its Filthineſs by a total Deſtruction: For ſoon after hapned a great Deluge, which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up all the Inhabitants of the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Bodies were puniſh'd for their Sins, yet their Souls were entertain'd in the Almighties Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>In this manner, according to the Opinion of the <hi>Benjans,</hi> ended the firſt Age of the World; and they further add, That God ſhew'd his Power in deſtroying the Creatures he had made, which perhaps elſe would never have been known; yet he Created a new World and People, which were all Clean, and deſerving of his Wiſdom and Mercy: And becauſe the firſt Age of the World was thus deſtroy'd by the wickedneſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he reſolv'd by means of three more perfect Perſons than the firſt, call'd <hi>Bremaw, Wiſtney,</hi> and <hi>Rudderey,</hi> to make a ſecond; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, God leaving the Heavens, deſcended upon a great Mountain call'd <hi>Meropurbattee,</hi> from the top of which he utter'd theſe words; <hi>Riſe up</hi> Bremaw, <hi>the firſt of Living Creatures of the ſecond Age:</hi> Whereupon the Earth opening, <hi>Bremaw</hi> ſtarted up out of the Bowels thereof, and at the ſame inſtant knew his Creator, and Worſhipp'd him: after which, God by a ſecond and third Command caus'd <hi>Wiſtney</hi> and <hi>Rudderey</hi> alſo to ariſe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him. But as God does nothing without ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration, and appoints all things to a certain end, ſo likewiſe he did not create theſe three Perſons to live alone in Idleneſs, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people the World, and gave to <hi>Bremaw,</hi> who was the firſt, the Power of making new Creatures; for (ſay the <hi>Benjans</hi>) as Princes do not Officiate their Affairs but by Agents, ſo did it not ſtand with God's Greatneſs to humble himſelf to make his own Creatures, as long as he was able to do it by means of his Servants.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Wiſtney,</hi> who was the ſecond, he gave the Charge of taking Care to preſerve thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which as he had commanded through his Mercy to be made, ſo it did likewiſe beſeem his Wiſdom to ſee them preſerv'd: Yet to <hi>Rudderey,</hi> who was the third, he give Power to deſtroy them; for he foreſaw that they would grow wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and deſerving of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And as God had given the Power to theſe three Perſons to make ſuch wonderful Creatures, he was alſo oblig'd to give them a means whereby they might be able to perform their ſeveral Offices. <hi>Bremaw</hi> therefore had the Power to Create and Produce ſuch Creatures as he thought moſt fit: And to the end <hi>Wiſtney</hi> might be able to preſerve them, God gave him a full Power over all things which might tend to their Preſervation, making him Lord of the Sun and Moon, Clouds, Rain, and the Dew which falls on the Earth, as alſo of Hills and Valleys, leaving it to his diſcretion to appoint the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Power of beſtowing Riches, Health, and Honor on whom he pleas'd; in a word, he made him Maſter of all things which tend to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſupport of Humane Creatures. And to the end <hi>Ruddery</hi> might be the onely Inſtrument to execute God's Juſtice, God gave him Power over all things which might occaſion the Ruin of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, giving him Power to chaſtize Sinners with Sickneſs, Poverty, War, Peſtilence, and Death.</p>
               <p>After their ſeveral Offices were preſcrib'd to theſe three Perſons, a certain time was limited them to live upon the Earth: And becauſe the Work of the Creation, which belong'd to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw,</hi> was perfected in the ſecond Age, he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly at the end thereof was taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to dwell with the Almighty. Furthermore, ſince the other Age was to be Peopled by thoſe which were preſerv'd from the General Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, <hi>Wiſtney</hi> ſtaid twice as long on the Earth as his Brother <hi>Bremaw,</hi> becauſe there was a longer time requir'd for their farther Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And becauſe the World was to be ended by a general Ruin and Deſtruction, therefore <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery</hi> was to ſtay three times longer on the Earth than <hi>Wiſtney,</hi> to the end that when the great day of Judgement ſhould come, he ſhould deſtroy all Creatures, and carry their Souls with him into a Place of Glory.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when they had all things granted them, wanting nothing but to put in execution thoſe Commandments which God had laid upon them, <hi>Bremaw</hi> began ſeriouſly to conſider with himſelf after what manner he might behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt honourably in the Employment that God had put him upon; when on a ſudden he felt a ſtrange alteration in his Body, accompanied with a general Pain through all his Parts, ſuch as that with a Woman in her Travel, foretelling ſome ſtrange and wonderful Event; his Body was in an inſtant ſwell'd after a ſtrange manner, and his Intrails grew ſenſibly bigger than before: At laſt his Body open'd in two Places, <hi>viz.</hi> on his Right and Left Side, out of which came two Twins, the one a Male, the other a Female, both of their full growth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bremaw</hi> having receiv'd Strength again, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in things concerning Religion, and call'd the Man <hi>Manow,</hi> and the Woman <hi>Ceteroupa,</hi> who after they had worſhipp'd God, thank'd <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw</hi> that brought them into the VVorld; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd his Bleſſing; they travell'd towards the Eaſt, ſetling on a Mountain call'd <hi>Munderpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vool,</hi> to the end that thoſe which they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get might ſpread themſelves Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South. No ſooner were they come to the foremention'd Mountain, but <hi>Ceteroupa</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd of three Sons and three Daughters, whereof the eldeſt Son was call'd <hi>Priauretta,</hi> the ſecond
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63517:167"/>
                  <hi>Outanapautha,</hi> the third <hi>Scomeraut;</hi> the eldeſt Daughter was nam'd <hi>Kammah,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Soone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retaw,</hi> and the third <hi>Sumboo.</hi> As ſoon as they came to Age, they were ſent to ſeveral Places, <hi>Priauretta</hi> and <hi>Kammah</hi> to the Weſt, to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain call'd <hi>Segund; Otanapautha</hi> and <hi>Soonurettaw</hi> to the North, to the Mountain <hi>Ripola; Someraut</hi> and <hi>Sumboo</hi> to the South, to the Mountain <hi>Supars;</hi> all which Countries they made very populous. By this means <hi>Bremaw</hi> was the firſt Father of all the Inhabitants of the Earth, whilſt <hi>Wiſtney</hi> took care for all neceſſary things for the preſervation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creatures which <hi>Bremaw</hi> had made, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them all the Bleſſings that make Men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this Life, till at laſt <hi>Ruddery</hi> ſent Sickneſs, Death, and a Curſe among the Children of Men, who by their wicked Lives had juſtly merited God's Vengeance.</p>
               <p>This was the manner of Government which God us'd for the reſtoring of the World, and all humane Creatures which were to inhabit in the ſecond Age.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, God (according to the Relation of the <hi>Benjans</hi>) taught Men to ſerve him after this manner.</p>
               <p>When God ſaw that there could be no Order nor lawful Government in thoſe Places where his Worſhip and Service was not Eſtabliſh'd, he reſolv'd to make Laws for the preventing of Man's committing thoſe Crimes which were the deſtruction of the firſt Age: In order whereunto he deſcended upon the Mountain <hi>Meropurbatee;</hi> to which Place he call'd <hi>Bremaw,</hi> to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in his Glory through a dark and thick Cloud, telling him, <q>That he was neceſſitated to deſtroy the firſt Age, by reaſon Men would not obey his Commands, which were contain'd in the Book he had given to <hi>Brammon.</hi>
                  </q> At the ſame time God gave <hi>Bremaw</hi> another Book, and commanded him to teach all things that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd therein. <hi>Bremaw</hi> to Execute his Office, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd God's Commandments to all People on the Earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Benjans</hi> call this Book <hi>Shaſter,</hi> that is, <hi>The Book of Written Words,</hi> which contains three Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes or Parts; the firſt whereof contains their Fundamental Laws, with an Explanation of each Commandment. The ſecond treats of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and teaches them the Ceremonies which are to be obſerv'd in their Religion. The third Treatiſe diſtinguiſhes all Men into certain Families or Tribes, and comprehends the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of each Tribe in particular, which is all that is contain'd in the Book <hi>Shaſter;</hi> out of which we will here ſet down the chief Heads thereof. The firſt Treatiſe, in which is deſcrib'd the Fundamental Laws which <hi>Bremaw</hi> taught, contain'd the following eight.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill any Creature that hath Life in it, for thou art one of the Creatures, and ſo is that; thou art endu'd with a Soul as that is, therefore thou ſhalt not take away the Life of any thing whatſoever it be, which belongs to me.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Thou ſhalt make a Contract with the five Senſes; Firſt with thy Eyes, that they may not ſee any thing that is ill. Secondly, with your Ears, that they may not hearken to any bad thing. Thirdly, with your Tongue. not to expreſs any ill words. Fourthly, with your Pallat, that you taſte nothing unclean, as Wine or the Fleſh of living Creatures. Laſtly, with your Hands, that they may not touch any thing to defile them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Thou ſhalt exactly obſerve and keep all the Days and Times appointed for Devotion, as likewiſe Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with Worſhipping and Praying, which thou muſt perform with an upright and zealous Heart.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not give any falſe Teſtimonies, or ſpeak Lies, by means of which thou mighteſt defraud thy Brother, and enrich thy ſelf by fraudulent means, when thou Tradeſt with him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Thou ſhalt be merciful to the Poor according to thy Power, and aſſiſt them in their Neceſſities with Meat, Wood, and other things they may ſtand in need of for their ſupport.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs the Poor, and ſerve thy ſelf with that Power which is given thee, to deſtroy thy Brother unjuſtly.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep certain Feaſts and Holidays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pampering thy Body, and feeding thy ſelf with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, but on the contrary, ſpend certain Days in Fasting; and in ſtead of Sleeping over much, Watch often, to be the better prepar'd for Praying, and for the performance of all other Holy Offices.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take any thing from thy Brother, whatever it be, wherewith thou art entruſted, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelf with what he ſhall give thee for thy Reward, remembring thou haſt no Right to that which belongs to another.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe eight Commandments are preſcrib'd to all the four Tribes in general; but beſides them they have two more, which are particular to each Tribe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Bramines</hi> and <hi>Schuddery,</hi> that is the Prieſts and Merchants, are ſtrictly oblig'd to obſerve their Religious Commandments, and have near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to another in Matters of Religion, as there is between thoſe of <hi>Kuttery</hi> and <hi>Wyſe,</hi> that is the Magiſtrates and Handicrafts. They aſcribe to the <hi>Bramines,</hi> which are the Prieſts, the firſt and ſecond Commandments, becauſe they place the chief of their Religion in theſe two things; firſt to prevent the killing of living Creatures, and next to abſtain from all forbidden things, as eating of Fleſh, drinking of Wine, and the like; which the <hi>Kutteries</hi> and <hi>Benjans</hi> are alſo ſtrictly to obſerve.</p>
               <p>They attribute particularly the third and fourth Commandments to <hi>Schuddery,</hi> as being very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Office, becauſe it may poſſeſs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Devotion, and prevent thoſe fraudulent Practiſes which are common among Traders.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Kuttery</hi> they preſcribe (being the Governors or Magiſtrates) the fifth and ſixth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they admoniſh the People of Love and Compaſſion to the Poor, well knowing that Oppreſſion is a common Sin among thoſe that are in Power.</p>
               <p>They preſcribe to <hi>Wyſ,</hi> or the Handicrafts, the ſeventh and eighth Commandments, becauſe thoſe kind of People require ſome Days for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation. They are alſo forbidden to Steal, to which they have great temptations and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, when they go to work in other Perſons Houſes. Laſtly, notwithſtanding they are oblig'd to obey all their Commandments in general, yet every Tribe obſerves thoſe two which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd them, with more Zeal than any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Treatiſe of the Book given to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw,</hi> contain'd the uſual Ceremonial Inſtitutions to be obſerv'd on certain Occaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> the often waſhing of their Bodies, and anointing them with certain red Salve, the making of Offerings and Prayers, and the manner of Marrying aad Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Notwithſtanding all which things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declar'd at large, yet it will be requiſite to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63517:167"/>give you an account of them, as <hi>Henry Lord</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them out of their Book call'd <hi>Shaſter,</hi> partly for their coherence in ſome things, and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in others.</p>
               <p>Firſt they are expreſly commanded to waſh their Bodies in a River, which as the <hi>Benjans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, began in the ſecond Age of the World, and ordain'd among other Religious Ceremonies, to mind them that the World was deſtroy'd once by Water for their Sins. This Ceremony is us'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the following manner: Firſt, they daub their Bodies all over with Mud or Dirt taken from the bottom of a River, to expreſs thereby the natural Pollution of Man: This done, they go to the River with their Faces turn'd towards the Sun, whilſt the <hi>Bramine</hi> with a loud voice ſpeaks theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, this Man is foul and unclean like the Mud of this River, but as the Water is able to waſh of this Filth, ſo we pray thee to cleanſe him of his Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prayer being ended, they dive three times under Water; while they are waſhing themſelves, the <hi>Bramine</hi> often calls upon the Name of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which is call'd <hi>Tappee,</hi> as alſo ſome other Streams in <hi>India,</hi> which are held in great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe of their waſhing themſelves therein: Among others that are thus accounted holy, are the Rivers <hi>Ganja</hi> and <hi>Narboda.</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Bramine</hi> names theſe Rivers, he that waſhes himſelf throws a handful of Rice into the Prieſts Lap, as an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they generally make to him. After which receiving an Abſolution of all their ſins, they depart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They make uſe of a certain red Salve or Ointment, with which they daub or anoint their Foreheads, where they ſtick certain Grains of Corn, ſignifying thereby, that God hath choſen and mark'd them as a People peculiar to him; but it ſerves only to preſerve the memory of their Baptiſm: they anoint themſelves ſeveral times a day, as often as they waſh themſelves. They utter ſeveral words, admoniſhing them of ſuch things as they are commanded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are commanded to make Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and ſay certain Prayers under the green Trees; which Cuſtom was Inſtituted by <hi>Wyſe,</hi> to whom God appear'd under a green Tree, as we have already related, commanding him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Devotion in ſuch Places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> call this Tree <hi>Lul;</hi> the <hi>Indians, Kaſta;</hi> the <hi>Portugueſe, Arbor de Raiz,</hi> that is, <hi>Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> becauſe its Boughs ſhooting down into the Ground, take Root, and grow up anew, ſo that one Tree often ſpreads it ſelf into a great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whereby ſeveral hundreds of Men may ſhade themſelves under them, ſecure from the Heat of the Sun, and from Rain.</p>
               <p>In one Place of this Country of <hi>Surratte,</hi> grows one of theſe Trees, from which the <hi>Indians</hi> dare not pluck a Leaf, fearing that they ſhould that Year wherein they had ſo offended. The <hi>Fakiers,</hi> and other poor People, ſleep under the ſame in the Night. They believe that great Sorrow will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe that offer any Injury to this Tree, breaking the leaſt Bough from it; under which when they meet, each Man brings his Offerings along with him. There they anoint their Bodies with ſeveral Ointments, and pour forth their Prayers, the number of which they expreſs by the ringing of a Bell; and in their Prayers they crave Health, Riches, and good ſucceſs in all their Undertakings. They often meet here in great numbers, and keep great Feaſts. They alſo build under theſe: Trees <hi>Pagods</hi> or Temples to their Idols, to which they ſhew great Reverence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They are oblig'd to ſay ſeveral Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their Temples, which would have a greater ſimilitude with the ordinary Worſhip, were they freed from certain ſuperſtitious Ceremonies to which they are oblig'd. Theſe their Prayers chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt in often calling upon the Name of God, and extolling his glorious Works. They alſo go in Proceſſions, whilſt their Prieſts ſing certain Prayers at the ringing of Bells; and alſo making Offerings to their Images, and many ſuch like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They are oblig'd to go to remote Streams, as to the <hi>Ganga,</hi> there to make Offerings, and to waſh their Bodies; which to perform, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands go thither every Year, carrying with them great quantities of Precious Stones, and other Riches, which they throw into the ſame. They account thoſe Saints, who at their Departure have their Mouths fill'd with the Water of this <hi>Ganga,</hi> or the Roof of their Mouths only moiſtned with the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They have another ſort of Worſhip, which conſiſts in calling upon their Saints, to whom they aſcribe the Power of effecting and proſpering all their Undertakings: Therefore thoſe that deſire to be happy in the State of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, call upon <hi>Hurmount;</hi> thoſe that go about Building, Pray to <hi>Gunnes;</hi> in Sickneſs they call upon <hi>Vegenaut;</hi> the Soldiers which deſire to be Victors, appeal to <hi>Bimohem;</hi> the poor and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, to <hi>Syer;</hi> and thoſe which live happily, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore <hi>Nykaſſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, They are oblig'd by virtue of the Law, to worſhip God as ſoon as any of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures appears to them after Sun-riſing. This Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremony and Sign of their Devotion, they generally ſhew to the Sun and Moon, which they call the two Eyes of God. They alſo reſpect cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Beaſts, which they account more clean than others, as Goats and Buffalo's, to which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe ſuch innocency and goodneſs, that they rub the Floors of their Chambers with the Dung of theſe Beaſts, fancying that thereby they are made Holy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is to be obſerv'd, that the manner of Baptizing and giving of Names to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is not one and the ſame with the Tribe of the <hi>Bramines;</hi> as with all the reſt, who only waſh their Children with Water, and afterwards one of their Relations taking a Pen, ſeemingly writes upon the Babes Forehead, and ſaith this ſhort Prayer, <hi>Lord, do thou write good things on this Childs Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> whereupon all thoſe that are preſent cry, <hi>We wiſh this may he effected:</hi> which done, they name the Child, and anoint its Temples with red Salve, to the end every one may know it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Church, and mark'd for one of the Children of God; thus ending their Ceremony.</p>
               <p>But the Children of the <hi>Bramines</hi> are not only waſh'd as the others, but anointed with Oyl, whilſt the Prieſt utters the following words: <hi>O Lord, we preſent thee this Child, born of a holy Tribe, anointed with Oyl, and waſh'd with Water.</hi> Beſides, they uſe ſeveral other Ceremonies; after which they Pray, that the Child may be a zealous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Lives of the <hi>Bramines,</hi> and ſet down ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Hour and Minute of the Childs Birth, and obſerve under what Planet it is born, that ſo they may know whether it ſhall be happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,

                  </gap> happieſt Day of his Life, and then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declare all the Dangers he has eſcap'd, and thoſe which yet threaten him.</p>
               <p>The third Treatiſe of the Book which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Bremaw,</hi> deſcribes after what manner they ought to live, what difference and dictinction they muſt obſerve in thoſe things which are mention'd in their ſeveral Tribes.</p>
               <p>They affirm, that there can be no better way found to Govern the World, than that which was us'd in the firſt Age, by means of four Tribes; that is to ſay, to have <hi>Bramines</hi> to Teach the Law of God to the People; <hi>Kutteries,</hi> to Govern and keep the People in Obedience to the Law; <hi>Schudderies,</hi> or Merchants, to Trade; and laſtly, <hi>Wyſes</hi> or Handicraft-men and Laborers, to ſupply others by their Labors with ſuch Neceſſaries as are wanting. For this reaſon, by virtue of this third Treatiſe of the foremention'd Book, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, in all their Tribes, as much as in them lies, to uphold this ancient manner of Governing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bramines</hi> is the firſt Tribe, and being lookt upon by the Commonalty as Prieſts, are of two ſorts; firſt there are common <hi>Bramines,</hi> which are more in number in <hi>India</hi> than any other; ſecondly, particular <hi>Bramines,</hi> far leſſer in number, and are by the <hi>Benjans</hi> call'd <hi>Verteas;</hi> by the Moors, <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs.</hi> The common ſort of <hi>Bramines</hi> conſiſt of ſeventy two Families or Tribes, who are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by ſo many eminent Men, who for their great Knowledge are highly eſteem'd amongſt them; they call them Soothſayers of ſuch and ſuch and ſuch a Place where they reſide. The chiefeſt of them bears the Name of <hi>Vikalnagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauger,</hi> that is, <hi>Soothſayer of Vikalnagra,</hi> a City ſo call'd. Likewiſe the next are denominated from the Places of their Abode; by which means the ſeventy two Tribes are diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
               <p>What concerns the Offices or Employments, of theſe <hi>Bramines,</hi> is already related at large.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the peculiar <hi>Bramines,</hi> they are call'd <hi>Verteas,</hi> and are generally Perſons of the Tribe of <hi>Schuddery,</hi> or Merchants, and are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who out of Zeal take upon them this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Office. They go Habited in white Woollen Cloth, which comes down to the Calves of their Legs, the remaining part of their Legs being naked. They never cover their Heads, as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Obedience and Reverence they ſhew to God: nor do they ſhave their Heads, but pull it out by the Roots, except a little upon the Crown of the Head. They alſo pull out their Beards after the ſame manner. There are ſeveral ſorts of theſe <hi>Bramines,</hi> whereof ſome are call'd <hi>Sonkaes,</hi> which never go to the Temples, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Religious Offices by themſelves. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort nam'd <hi>Tappaes,</hi> ſay their Prayers in the Temples. A third ſort call'd <hi>Kurthurs,</hi> worſhip God in private without any Company. The fourth ſort are call'd <hi>Onkelaus,</hi> which admit of no Images. The fifth ſort, which is the ſtricteſt of all, bear the Name of <hi>Puſhaleaus;</hi> theſe have a certain Feſtival Day nam'd <hi>Putcheſon,</hi> which they keep every Month for five Days together; but between each Day of theſe five they obſerve a Time to Faſt in. This Feaſt is generally kept in a Perſon of great Quality's Houſe, and Charitable People commonly at that time, give Money to the Poor, that they may not kill any Beaſts, or other Living Creature.</p>
               <p>This Tribe is much ſtricter in many things than the other <hi>Bramines;</hi> for Marriage, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to others, is forbidden them: and they are ſatisfi'd with leſs Meat and Drink than the reſt, never eating any thing, except on the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Feaſt-Day, but what is given them, and never keep any thing for the next Day, or for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Meal. They preſerve and hold all things that have Life in greater Veneration than the other, and never drink Water till it be boil'd, to the end the Vapor, which they account the Soul thereof, ſhould have time to evaporate and fly out. They keep little Sticks conſtantly by them to ſpread abroad their own Dung, ſo to prevent the Worms which might poſſibly be in the ſame, from being trod to death. They keep Hoſpitals for ſick and lame Fowl, which they buy for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and endeavor to cure them, All things are in common amongſt them. They have but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der opinion of waſhing themſelves in Water, but rather delight in foul and ditty Bodies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Tribe is that of the <hi>Kutteries,</hi> which derives its Name from <hi>Kuttery,</hi> the ſecond Son of <hi>Porous:</hi> And becauſe God had given him Power to Govern others, all Kings and Martial People pretend to be Extracted from them. The place of the Book of <hi>Bremaw</hi> wherein the things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Tribe was deſcrib'd, was fill'd with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commandments concerning Government and State-Policy, but of little conſequence. Theſe <hi>Kutteries</hi> may be deſcrib'd theſe ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> How they were formerly in their flouriſhing Eſtate, how they liv'd after when firſt they began to decay, and how they live at preſent.</p>
               <p>In their flouriſhing Eſtate they were Kings and Governors of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and eſpecially of this Country of <hi>Surratte,</hi> and were at that time call'd <hi>Rajas,</hi> that is, <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince;</hi> of which ſome poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd bigger Tracts of Land than others, according as they were more or leſs Powerful. Theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> have commonly four ſorts of Perſons by them of Noble Aſpect and Quality; the firſt ſort whereof were <hi>Bramines,</hi> who by means of their Soothſayers acquainted their Kings with ſuch Times as were by them accounted fortunate for any Deſign. The ſecond was call'd <hi>Pardon,</hi> that is, <hi>A Politician,</hi> or one experienc'd in Matters of State, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd all the King's Edicts, and had the general Care of the King's Buſineſs. The third was call'd <hi>Moldar,</hi> who perform'd the Office of Gentleman-Uſher to the King, being continually with him and his Company. The fourth, call'd <hi>Diſnache,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd all Martial Affairs, and Commanded as General over all the Militia. They ſay, that the <hi>Rajas</hi> were Extracted out of thirty ſix illuſtrious Families, ſome deriv'd of the Family or Tribe of <hi>Chaurah,</hi> others out of that call'd <hi>Solenkees,</hi> ſome of <hi>Vaggela,</hi> others of <hi>Dodepuchaes,</hi> and others from the <hi>Paramars;</hi> ſo that a Perſon of mean Extract can never attain to any great Dignity, but only thoſe which were Extracted from one of theſe thirty ſix Tribes.</p>
               <p>In this manner the <hi>Rajas</hi> liv'd in their flouriſhing Eſtate; as to what concerns their Fall, according to the teſtimony of their Hiſtories, a certain holy and vertuous Woman, nam'd <hi>Rannedvil,</hi> progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated on her Death-bed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the State of the <hi>Rajas</hi> would decline under the Government of <hi>Raviſaldee,</hi> an eminent <hi>Raja;</hi> which hapned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as may appear by the following Relation.</p>
               <p>There was formerly, as their Hiſtories make mention, a <hi>Raja</hi> call'd <hi>Syde Raviſaldee,</hi> after whoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63517:168"/>Deceaſe his Son built a ſtately Tomb, in a Place call'd <hi>Sythepolapore,</hi> ſo to expreſs to his Succeſſors the Affection and Reverence he bore to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When this magnificent Structure was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with great Labor and Charge, he conſulted with the <hi>Bramines,</hi> and deſir'd to know of them if the ſtately Tomb he had built would be of any long continuance, or would be ſubject to decay, as well as other worldly things, &amp; by whom it ſhould be ruin'd? Upon which a <hi>Madewnauger,</hi> experienc'd in the <hi>Bramines</hi> Art, anſwer'd, <hi>That a certain</hi> Sultan <hi>call'd</hi> Alaudin, <hi>King of</hi> Dely, <hi>ſhould ruine the ſame, and make great Conqueſt in</hi> Surratte. <hi>Syde Raviſaldee,</hi> to prevent the ruine of this Structure, ſent the <hi>Bramine Madewnauger</hi> with great Sums of Money to <hi>Dely,</hi> to this <hi>Alaudin,</hi> to obtain of him, that he would let his Fathers Bones reſt, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Temple he had built for him. But the <hi>Bramine</hi> coming thither, could not find any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Name, in any Government or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but after long ſearch, he was inform'd, that a certain Wood-cutter living there had a Son of that Name; whereupon going to this Man, who was extremely amaz'd to ſee him, he related to him his Journey, whilſt the Son of <hi>Alaudin</hi> ſtanding behind his Father, was preparing a Diſh of Goats-fleſh. The <hi>Bramine</hi> going to him, told him of the good Fortune that ſhould attend him, and that on a certain Day he would come to be King of <hi>Dely,</hi> and make huge Conqueſts in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratte;</hi> and that <hi>Syde Raviſaldee</hi> had ſent to proffer him a great Sum of Money, requeſting, that when he ſhould be Victor, he would be pleas'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Temple which he had built as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his Fathers Grave at <hi>Sythepolapore. Alaudin</hi> made this Anſwer, <hi>That it was beyond all poſſibility he ſhould be ſo powerful, and attain ſuch great Fortunes, yet nevertheleſs, if the Heavens had ordain'd it, it was not poſſible to prevent it, and it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for him to defend that Temple.</hi> He alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly refus'd the Preſents and the Money which the <hi>Bramine</hi> proffer'd him; but his Father and Mother, whom his Neceſſity gave good Advice to, and knew better than he what was good for them, perſuaded him to receive the Preſents, partly to relieve themſelves out of the preſent Indigency in which they were, and make uſe thereof, as an Inſtrument to attain to thoſe things which were Propheſied. <hi>Alaudin</hi> hereupon liking their Advice, receiv'd them, and gave to the <hi>Bramine</hi> a written Paper to this effect: <hi>That ſince the Heavens had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed he ſhould fetch ſome Stones from this Structure, he would only take them from one Corner, without ruining it, as well to perform that which was foretold him, as to anſwer the Requeſts of</hi> Syde Raviſaldee.</p>
               <p>With this Money <hi>Alaudin</hi> rais'd a conſiderable number of Soldiers, and happily ſucceeded in all his Enterprizes, inſomuch that being preſs'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by his good ſucceſs, and emboldned by the Propheſie, that he ſhould do ſuch valiant Exploits, he at laſt attain'd to be King of <hi>Dely,</hi> conquer'd <hi>Surratte,</hi> and perfom'd that which he had promis'd <hi>Syde Raviſaldee;</hi> and alſo ruin'd many <hi>Rajas,</hi> to the great prejudice of the State of the <hi>Benjans,</hi> who then began to decline.

               <p>As to what concerns their preſent Condition, ſome <hi>Rajas</hi> that were in a good Condition, and others that retir'd into the middle of the Country, into Places which could not be conquer'd, are yet in Being, and Rob thoſe Caravans which Travel by the Places of their Reſidence, and often Sally out to the Gates of the moſt ſtrong and populous Cities for Booty. They have many brave Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that accompany them in theſe Enterpriſes, who are by ſome call'd <hi>Raſphootes,</hi> or <hi>Rasboten,</hi> and <hi>Rasbookes,</hi> and by others <hi>Resbuten, Raſpouten, Reiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butos,</hi> and <hi>Ragipous,</hi> which ſignifie <hi>Kings Children;</hi> for being of the Tribe of the <hi>Kutteries,</hi> in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they were deriv'd from thoſe Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were deſtroy'd in the Conqueſt of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> Among thoſe that were not conquer'd, and are at preſent living, is one <hi>Raja Surmulgee,</hi> whoſe Reſidence is at <hi>Raſpeplaw;</hi> another <hi>Raja Berum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> at <hi>Molere;</hi> the <hi>Raja Ramnagar, Raja Burmul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee,</hi> and the great <hi>Raja Rannah,</hi> who have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd many a Field-Battel againſt the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi>s Army. There are above a hundred <hi>Rajas</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes ſprinkled up and down in this Realm, that are not under Subjection to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> nor pay any Tribute to him: ſome of them dwell near, others a good diſtance from <hi>Dely;</hi> among them are fifteen or ſixteen very rich and powerful, but chiefly five or ſix; as the <hi>Raja</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Country of <hi>Jeſſelmeer,</hi> who formerly Reign'd as Emperor over the <hi>Rajas,</hi> and is ſaid to be Extracted from King <hi>Porous;</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeingue,</hi> and <hi>Jeſſomſeingue,</hi> which are rais'd to that heighth, that if thoſe three would but joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would keep the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſufficiently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, each of them being able in an inſtant to bring twenty thouſand Horſe into the Field, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Exercis'd and Arm'd than thoſe of the <hi>Mogol.</hi>

               <p>The preſent <hi>Great Mogol</hi>'s chiefeſt Soldiers are <hi>Rajas,</hi> as <hi>Jeſſeingue, Jeſſomſeingue,</hi> and others, to whom he gives great Salaries, to be always prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a certain number of <hi>Ragipouts,</hi> their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and maintains and keeps them as <hi>Omrahs,</hi> that is to ſay, as other ſtrange Lords and <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> ſometimes among thoſe Forces which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has to Guard him, and ſometimes in the Field. Theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> are commonly oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame Duties that the <hi>Omrahs</hi> do, that is, to be upon the Guard, though with this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they do it not in any Garriſons like the <hi>Omrahs,</hi> but in their Tents, for they cannot brook being lock'd up twenty four hours together in a Fort; nor do they ever go into any of them, but with a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63517:169"/>great Company of reſolute Men, which have ſworn to die by them on the Spot, as it ſometimes happens when any Deſign has been plaid upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> is oblig'd for ſeveral Reaſons to keep theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> in his Service: Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jas</hi> People are very warlike and valiant, and there are ſeveral of them able to bring above twenty thouſand Horſe into the Field. Secondly, that he may be the better able to keep in Subjection thoſe <hi>Rajas</hi> which are under his Pay, and force them to pay Tribute when they refuſe, or when out of fear or otherwiſe they will not venture out of their Country to come into the Field when the <hi>Mogol</hi> has occaſion for them. Thirdly, to heighten or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Jealouſies one among the other the more, by ſhewing greater Favor to one than to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Fourthly, to employ them againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> or his Enemies the <hi>Omrahs</hi> and Governors, in caſe any ſhould offer to rebell againſt him. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to uſe them againſt the King of <hi>Golkonda,</hi> when he refuſes to pay Tribute; or againſt the King of <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> when he offers to Plunder them, or bring them under his Subjection; at which time the <hi>Mogol</hi> cannot repoſe any confidence in his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs,</hi> which are moſt of them <hi>Perſians,</hi> and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> not <hi>Sounnys,</hi> but <hi>Chias,</hi> as the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Golkonda</hi> is. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and chiefly, to employ them againſt the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when any opportunity preſents, for then he cannot confide in his <hi>Omrahs,</hi> who, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are moſt of them <hi>Perſians,</hi> and conſequently can have no inclination to Fight againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural King.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Reſbutes,</hi> or Subjects of theſe <hi>Rajas</hi> or <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Princes, were anciently, in the time of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> Kings of Countries, and Peers of this Realm, who defended their Country againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, maintaining a continual War; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ram</hi> granted them the liberty of taking as many Wives as they pleas'd, as alſo other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Families, that ſo the Soldiers might not ſettle their Affections in one Place, but might be the freer to make Conqueſt, and propagate whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e're they came; for were they confin'd to one Woman, they might perhaps take her along with them to their conquer'd Places, and ſetling there, be unwilling to depart thence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reſbutes</hi> are a ruſtick, deceitful, ill-natur'd, but yet a ſtrong, valiant, and undaunted People, fearing no Dangers, though threatned with Death; whereas other <hi>Indian Heathens</hi> are mean ſpirited and timerous, carrying their Arms in their Mouths, and eſteem Railing before Fighting.</p>
               <p>They are very famous for Robbing and Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for they Plunder the Caravans, and murder all Travellers they meet with, if they make the leaſt Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>They have ſeveral little Harbors for ſmall Barques, with which they Pyrate along the Coaſt.</p>
               <p>They go naked from their Navel upwards, and wear <hi>Turbants,</hi> which differ in faſhion from the <hi>Mogols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their chiefeſt and only care, from the eldeſt to the youngeſt, is how to handle a Sword well.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rajas,</hi> or Kings of the <hi>Ragipous,</hi> give their Subjects Lands for their Subſiſtance, on condition they ſhallal ways be ready to Fight when call'd to it; ſo that they might properly be ſtyl'd a ſort of Nobles, if the <hi>Rajas</hi> gave them Lands for them and their Children. They drink <hi>Amfion</hi> in great abundance, which they uſe from their Infancy; and when at any time they go to meet their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they take a double Portion: for <hi>Amfion</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldning, or rather inebriating, makes them fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of any Danger; ſo that they maintain a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel like ſo many ravenous Beaſts, never retreating, but die reſolutely at the Feet of their <hi>Raja.</hi> They want nothing but good Diſcipline to make them good Soldiers, for Strength and Valor they have enough. It is very pleaſant to ſee them intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the foremention'd <hi>Amfion,</hi> how they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and bid each other farewel, like Men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account of nothing but Death: For among ſo many Sects of <hi>Hindouns</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Mogol,</hi> there is only one Tribe of Soldiers or Fighting People call'd <hi>Reſbutees,</hi> of whom the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> for their Valor, and ſome other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is neceſſitated, though a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a <hi>Heathen,</hi> to entertain a great number in his Service, treating them like other <hi>Omrahs,</hi> and making uſe of them in his Army as if they were <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> nay, they are promoted to the greateſt Offices, and higheſt Employments under the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> as alſo under the King of <hi>Viſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour</hi> and <hi>Golkonda.</hi> Their Arms are Half-pikes, Swords or Simiters, and Shields; which being large and hollow, are faſhion'd like a Bee-hive, and ſerve them to feed their Horſes and Camels out of. Moſt of the <hi>Rajas</hi> uſe Horſes which are ſwift of foot, handſom, and ſtrong, and are always rid unſhod.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reſbutes</hi> eat all manner of Meat, except Beef and the Fleſh of Buffalo's; which Beaſts they hold in great Veneration. They drink Palm-Wine and Brandy, but not out of a Veſſel out of which any other Tribes have drank before. They are all of them <hi>Heathens,</hi> and would never permit any <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to mix amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The Women reſolutely leap into thoſe Fires in which their Husbands were conſum'd.</p>
               <p>The third Tribe or Family, which is that of the <hi>Schudderies,</hi> derives its Name from <hi>Schuddery,</hi> the third Son of <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parkoutee,</hi> who was deſign'd for Trade; for all Traders are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under that Name and Tribe.</p>
               <p>That which the Book given to <hi>Bremaw</hi> expreſt concerning this Tribe, conſiſted only in a few Commandments, inſtructing them how to live Honorably in their Emyloyments, to be Juſt as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63517:169"/>well in Words as Deeds, and not to practiſe any Deceit or Fraud in their Trades, either in Buying or Selling.</p>
               <p>Amongſt this Tribe are thoſe which by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> according to <hi>Texeira,</hi> are call'd <hi>Beneans,</hi> though he affirms their right Name to be <hi>Vaneans;</hi> but their common Name is <hi>Benjans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some aſcribe a peculiar Country to the <hi>Benjans,</hi> and border the ſame on one ſide of the Kingdom of <hi>Brampous,</hi> from which it is ſeparated by the River <hi>Tynde,</hi> and on the other at the Country <hi>Surratte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Towns of this Country are <hi>Daytaote</hi> near <hi>Surratte,</hi> and a Days Journey from <hi>Naubonne; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbey</hi> and <hi>Saylote,</hi> five Leagues from <hi>Netherkey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country yields all ſorts of Grain and Fruit in great abundance, eſpecially Lemmons, Sugar-Canes, and Cotton.</p>
               <p>Under the Name of <hi>Benjans</hi> are comprehended all thoſe that are Merchants and Broakers; for there is nothing bought but by the Mediation and Approbation of thoſe which are call'd <hi>Benjans,</hi> which in the Language of the <hi>Brahmines</hi> ſignifies <hi>An Innocent and Juſt People;</hi> for they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that a Waſp or Flye, or any other living Creature, ſhould be hurt, enduring patiently to be beaten without reſiſtance. They manifeſt themſelves to be a very Juſt and Pious People; for which reaſon, and becauſe they are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Country, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants employ them as Broakers, to Buy and Sell for them. They range all over <hi>Aſia</hi> in great numbers to Traffick, but reſide chiefly in <hi>Surratte.</hi> Moreover, they Buy and Sell after a ſtrange and peculiar manner, quite different from any other People; for the <hi>Benjan</hi> or Broaker that treats with the Seller, making a Price of the Goods, appears with a little Board full of Figures, which is ty'd about his Waſte, and laying it on his Knee, points to the number of Guilders which the Buyer is willing to give; after which the Seller in like manner expreſſes his Mind, by pointing to the Number which he will have for his Commodity.</p>
               <p>Thus they Buy and Sell without ſpeaking a word, according to the Commandments of their Law.</p>
               <p>The fourth Tribe or Family, which is that of the <hi>Wyſes,</hi> hath its Denomination from <hi>Wyſe,</hi> the fourth Son of <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parkoutee,</hi> who was ſent to invent all Arts and Handicrafts; wherefore all Artiſts and Mechanicks are comprehended under this Tribe: The Commandments relating to them, and contain'd in the Book deliver'd to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw,</hi> tend chiefly to inſtruct them how to behave themſelves juſtly and honeſtly in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Name <hi>Wyſe</hi> ſignifies <hi>A Hireling,</hi> or one that is us'd like a Servant, becauſe theſe People work for thoſe that have occaſion for them, as <hi>Wyſe</hi> did, and all thoſe that deriv'd from him.</p>
               <p>This Tribe conſiſts of two ſorts of People; for ſome like the <hi>Benjans,</hi> abſtain from Fleſh and Wine, or uſe them very ſparingly: The others are the <hi>Heathens</hi> of <hi>Viſceraun,</hi> which they call <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd,</hi> or <hi>Unclean Pagans,</hi> becauſe they allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty of eating Fleſh, Fiſh, and other Creatures that had Life. Theſe are generally the Ruſticks, and meaneſt ſort of People, which are <hi>Coulees.</hi> And as the moſt zealous of theſe <hi>Heathens</hi> have the greateſt reſemblance in Points of their Religion with the <hi>Kutteries,</hi> ſo do they likewiſe agree in the number of their Tribes, which are thirty ſix, equal to the Trades among them.</p>
               <p>In all Mechanical Operations they uſe as few Tools as is poſſible, performing every thing they do in a contrary manner to that of the <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in ſhort the Contents of the third Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Book of <hi>Bremaw,</hi> concerning the four Tribes or Families, according as they live to this day.</p>
               <p>This Book, which contain'd the Grounds of their Religion, and Rules of Government, being firſt given to <hi>Bremaw,</hi> and by him deliver'd to the <hi>Brahmines,</hi> who publiſh'd the ſame among the People, by teaching them the Precepts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Rules of Life which each Tribe were to obſerve; in order to which, thoſe who had Power to Govern, kept their People in ſubjection, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every one duly to perform his Office; the Prieſts or <hi>Brahmines</hi> inſtructed the People in their Religions, the Merchants drove the Trade, and the Handicrafts follow'd each their ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to the great ſatisfaction of all thoſe that made uſe of them.</p>
               <p>Affairs being thus manag'd in the ſecond Age, all things went very well; Religion was ſtrictly obſerv'd and honor'd, Prayers were directed to God, and the three Perſons, <hi>Bremaw, Wiſtney,</hi> and <hi>Ruddery;</hi> the Banks of Rivers were frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, and the daily and uſual Cleanſing never neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p>But after the World increaſed, the Inhabitants thereof grew wicked, and degenerated from their firſt Principles; the <hi>Brahmines</hi> became Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; the <hi>Kutteries</hi> or Governors grew proud and ambitious, oppreſſing their Subjects, and abuſing their Authority; the Merchants dealt fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Handicrafts grew idle, and ſet too high a Price upon their Lahor.</p>
               <p>The World thus degenerating, God was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely incens'd thereat, and deſcended on the Mountain <hi>Merapurbatee,</hi> where he acquainted <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw</hi> how hainous the Sins of Mankind were, that he might admoniſh them to turn from their wicked Ways, and warn them of the approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which their Offences had juſtly merited.</p>
               <p>The World hearkned a while to his Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but ſoon after ſlighted them, and return'd to the commiſſion of their former Crimes, which oblig'd <hi>Bremaw</hi> to intreat God for them: but God being unwilling to be reconcil'd to them, took him away, his limited time being expir'd, that ſo he might not be a Witneſs of thoſe dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſoon after were to fall upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men.</p>
               <p>Then God acquainted <hi>Wiſtney</hi> with his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſtroy all humane Creatures: wherefore <hi>Wiſtney</hi> interceded for them; but God not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, commanded <hi>Ruddery,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to puniſh all Offenders, to raiſe a great Wind out of the Earth to deſtroy the People, and blow them away like Duſt from the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruddery</hi> hereupon provok'd the Winds which were impriſon'd in the Bowels of the Earth, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to break forth with great violence, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they ſhook the Foundations of the Earth; the Day grew as dark as the Night, the Hills and Mountains were turn'd topſie-turvy, and the River <hi>Ganges</hi> remov'd out of its place; ſo that this terrible Storm deſtroy'd all Mankind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few Perſons, whom God permitted <hi>Wiſtney</hi> to preſerve, for the propagating and re-peopling the World in the third Age, the ſecond being ended in this diſmal manner.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:63517:170"/>
               <p>When <hi>Ruddery</hi> had aſſwag'd the rage and fury of the Winds, all things were ſtill and quiet, yet in a deplorable Condition, to ſee the World thus depriv'd of its Inhabitants, and utterly ruin'd; ſome were bruis'd againſt the Rocks, others lay heap'd one upon another in the Fields; which the Almighty ſeeing, was troubled at it, and <hi>Ruddery</hi> alſo very much griev'd to have been the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now ſince theſe great Misfortunes and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments proceeded from the bad Conduct of the Kings, and thoſe who Govern'd, God utterly deſtroy'd the Tribe of the <hi>Kutteries.</hi> Thoſe that were ſav'd by the Prayers of <hi>Wiſtney,</hi> conſiſted in a ſmall number, and were only of the three other Tribes. But becauſe the four ſorts of Tribes were ſo perfectly neceſſary for the Governing of the World, inſomuch that it could not be without them, and God had wholly deſtroy'd the Family of the <hi>Kutteries,</hi> therefore he reſolv'd to renew the ſame by a Prince, and ordain'd that the Kings for the future ſhould be Extracted out of the Family of the <hi>Brahmines,</hi> the chiefeſt whereof that were then living having been preſerv'd by <hi>Wiſtney,</hi> were call'd <hi>Ducerat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Child which was born after this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Deſtruction, was ordain'd to be the Race of Kings and Princes; who being zealouſly brought up, manag'd both the Affairs of State and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Governing the People with great Wiſdom and Piety, according to their ſeveral Tribes; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd many heroick Acts, and was a Protector of all <hi>Brahmines</hi> and other Spiritual Perſons. His Name was <hi>Ram,</hi> and by his Juſt and Pious Life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to that Dignity, that his Name is to this day exceedingly honor'd amongſt them; for in their uſual Salutations they with a loud Voice cry <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> that is, <hi>I wiſh you Health and all Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis certain many Juſt and Pious Kings Reign'd after him, but as all things do daily degenerate, ſo in proceſs of Time receding farther and farther from their original Purity, they grew proud and ambitious, inſomuch that they acted daily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Commandments comprehended in the Book of <hi>Bremaw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe hainous Enormities did once more ſo highly incenſe the Almighty, that he gave Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>Ruddery</hi> to open the Earth, that it might ſwallow them up alive, except a few of each of the four Tribes, which he preſerv'd to re-people the World anew with. And in this manner ended the third Age of the World.</p>
               <p>Soon after God commanded that the World ſhould be re-planted by thoſe that were preſerv'd, which was one <hi>Kyſteney</hi> or <hi>Kiſtna,</hi> who was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous King, Wiſe and Religious, and one of the moſt comely Perſons of the former Age. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Religion with great Zeal, inſomuch that during his Life there was great Reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People, and very hopeful beginnings of Piety and Honeſty.</p>
               <p>When by <hi>Kyſteney</hi>'s coming <hi>Wiſtney</hi>'s time was expir'd, God (as they relate) took him up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there being no further need of his, Service here below, becauſe there would be no other World after this fourth Age; which, now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will (according to the Opinion of the <hi>Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>) laſt much longer than any of the former; and that after its ruine, <hi>Ruddery</hi> will be taken up to Heaven likewiſe.</p>
               <p>They call theſe four Ages by four ſeveral Names, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt <hi>Kurtain,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Dnau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> the third <hi>Tetrajos,</hi> and the fourth <hi>Kolee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of deſtroying this laſt Age will, as the <hi>Brahmines</hi> relate, be much more terrible than any of the former, to wit, by Fire: at what time <hi>Ruddery</hi> will gather all his Powers together, as abſolutely neceſſary for the execution of ſo grand a Deſtruction. The Moon will ſhine red, the Beams of the Sun will be like the Flames of burning Brimſtone; Thunder and Lightning will make a dreadful noiſe; the Sea will change into all manner of Colours, and Fire and Smoke will cover the ſurface of the Earth; the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which the Heavens were firſt made, will maintain War againſt one another, and the World being thereby utterly deſtroy'd, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into its firſt <hi>Primordia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The World will be deſtroy'd by Fire, as they ſuppoſe, for this reaſon, That it muſt be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by that which gave it beginning; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conſiſts of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, therefore it muſt be deſtroyd by theſe four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the former Ages (on which this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is grounded) were deſtroy'd, the firſt by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſecond by Wind, and the third by Earth; therefore the fourth and laſt muſt be conſum'd by Fire.</p>
               <p>This being finiſh'd, <hi>Ruddery</hi> ſhall carry all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls up to Heaven, there to reſt in the Boſom of the Almighty; but all Bodies will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: for they deny the Reſurrection of the Body, affirming, That Heaven is too pure a Place for ſuch groſs and unclean Bodies.</p>

               <p>Five Leagues Journey from <hi>Agra</hi> is a Caſtle call'd <hi>Hoffer,</hi> the moſt eminent, and the ſtrongeſt of all the Province of <hi>Chandiſh;</hi> it is built on the top of a high and ſteep Mountain, incredibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd by Nature, and able to contain forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe: in the middle of it are Springs which water the Mountain, and make the Earth ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the production of Graſs, Herbs, and Corn, that there is no want either of Proviſions or other Neceſſaries: it is alſo Planted round about with very fine Braſs Guns, which were brought thither by the laſt King of <hi>Surratte.</hi> But the Water which ſprings out of this Mountain is very unwholſom to drink, and cauſes Worms to grow in the Legs; which was the only Inſtrument whereby <hi>Ekbar</hi> conquer'd this Place.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Brampour</hi> are very affable and courteous, occaſion'd perhaps by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting commonly with many of the Nobility, by whoſe Example the Vulgar are very much civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd. Every Perſon may Hunt freely, without any interruption; and thoſe that will not go on foot, may be furniſh'd with a Horſe at a very low Rate.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Kanowe</hi> drive a great Trade in Clothes, Swords, Muſquets, and a certain Fruit to Dye withal; and thoſe of <hi>Brampour</hi> in Cloth of Gold and Silver, Silks, and Woollen Cloth.</p>
               <p>The Country is ſufficiently fortifi'd againſt an Enemy; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1609. the King of <hi>Kanowe</hi> came with an Army of fifty thouſand Elephants, thirty thouſand Horſe, ten thouſand Camels, and three thouſand Dromedaries, to attack the ſame. It is at this day Govern'd by a Subſtitute of the <hi>Great Mogol</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are <hi>Heathens,</hi> and worſhip the Sun as their Supreme God: They eat not the Fleſh of any living Creature, according to the manner of the <hi>Pythagoreans.</hi> They adore all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as Gods, and worſhip that Beaſt they meet with firſt in the Morning for their God all that Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. the City of <hi>Brampour,</hi> with the whole Kingdom, and Fort of <hi>Sye,</hi> was conquer'd by the <hi>Great Mogol Ekbar:</hi> for at the coming of <hi>Ekbar</hi> with his Army, after having conquer'd the Kingdom of <hi>Dekan,</hi> King <hi>Miram</hi> deſerted die Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Brampour,</hi> and fled with all the Inhabitants and their Goods to the Fort <hi>Sye,</hi> ſo that <hi>Ekbar</hi> got nothing but the empty City, and therefore went from thence to <hi>Sye</hi> with an Army of 200000 Men. The Fortreſs was plentifully ſtor'd for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years with Wood, Corn, and other Proviſions, for ſixty thouſand Men, and was fortifi'd with three thouſand Pieces of Ordnance. In the Fort was, beſides King <hi>Miram,</hi> and the ſeven other Heroick Princes; which though of the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Religion, yet Extracted <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſole Conduct of this War, fortifi'd the Fort with no leſs Care than Art; ſo that the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi>'s Labor, though he had beſieg'd the Fort with two hundred thouſand, was all in vain; for the Beſieged, by the convenient Situation of the Fort, their continual diſcharging of great Guns, and prudent management of Affairs, they prevented him from taking the ſame by Storm. When <hi>Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> ſaw that it was impoſſible to Conquer the Fort by Force, he reſolv'd to try what he could do by Policy; wherefore he endeavor'd to attain his Ends by Money and Preſents, and deſir'd to enter into Conference with King <hi>Miram,</hi> ſwearing by his Head, the greateſt Oath imaginable, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he had ſpoken wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63517:171"/>Head, when one of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Princes taking hold of him, threw him on the Ground; to which rude Affront 'twas judg'd <hi>Ekbar</hi> conſented, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ſeemingly reprehended him for his raſhneſs, and mildly perſwaded <hi>Miram</hi> to ſend Letters to the Watches which Guarded the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Walls: After which <hi>Miram</hi> requir'd liberty to return to the Caſtle; but <hi>Ekbar</hi> not regarding, his Oath, would not permit him to go back again. The <hi>Abyſſinian</hi> Governor was no ſooner inform'd of what had paſs'd, but he ſent his Son with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Mogol;</hi> in which he tax'd him with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, for detaining <hi>Miram</hi> contrary to his Oath, adviſing him to to let him return peaceably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe. The <hi>Mogol</hi> hereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the whole management of Affairs were left to the Diſcretion of this <hi>Abyſſinian,</hi> thought if he could but corrupt him, the Place might be eaſily ſubdu'd; wherefore he ask'd the Son, If his Father would not come thither, in caſe King <hi>Miram</hi> ſhould command him? To which the Youth boldly reply'd, <hi>That his Father was no ſuch Perſon as he took him for, neither would he leave his Caſtle to come and Conſult with him; that he muſt in vain expect to obtain the Fort with his Father's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and if he would not releaſe</hi> Miram, <hi>yet there ſhould not long want a Succeſſor.</hi> Which confident Anſwer ſo incens'd <hi>Ekbar,</hi> that he caus'd the young Man immediately to be Stabb'd: which when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had notice of, he preſently ſent the <hi>Mogol</hi> word, That he would beg of the Gods never to behold the Face of ſuch a perfidious Prince; and afterwards taking his Saſh in his Hand, he went amongſt the Soldiers, and thus beſpake them: <hi>Oh Brothers, the Winter approaches, which will drive the</hi> Mogol <hi>from the Siege, and, to avoid their utter Ruin, force them all to retire home: None but God ſhall ever he able to Conquer this Place, unleſs the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof will ſurrender the ſame; therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve valiantly to defend the ſame.</hi> Having ended this Speech, he went and Strangled himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. After his Deceaſe the Inhabitants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Place for ſome time, kept the <hi>Mogol</hi> continually employ'd; who, after he had us'd all poſſible means in vain, having no great Guns at hand wherewith to batter down the Walls, at laſt reſolv'd to try if he could purchaſe the Inhabitants to a Surrender by great Sums of Money; which to accompliſh, he ſent to the Governors very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Preſents of Gold and Silver; whereby he did ſo cool and abate their Courage, that none of the ſeven Succeſſors of the Realm durſt aſſume the Government; for they perceiving the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to be fearful, and their Courage no longer to exert it ſelf, could foreſee and expect nothing but the ſudden loſs of the Place; and accordingly it ſo fell out: for after a few Days the Fort was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and with it the whole Kingdom was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <hi>Mogol,</hi> who got peaceable poſſeſſion thereof, with an invaluable Treaſure.

               <p>The Metropolis bears the ſame Name with the Province of <hi>Agra,</hi> and lies in 28 Degrees and 7 Minutes North Latitude, on the Banks of the River <hi>Jemini,</hi> which glides by its Walls, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embogues near the City <hi>Andakoda,</hi> into the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> two days Journey from <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to <hi>Herbert,</hi> this City was formerly call'd <hi>Nagra,</hi> and anciently <hi>Dionyſia,</hi> and was built by <hi>Bacchus;</hi> but this ſeems incredulous, becauſe within this hundred years the City <hi>Ratipor</hi> was far more beautiful, and bigger than that of <hi>Agra,</hi> which is believ'd to have had its Denomination from the River <hi>Arrany,</hi> which (as <hi>Arrian</hi> affirms) falls into the <hi>Ganges.</hi> It was built by King <hi>Ekbar</hi> after his Conqueſt of <hi>Surratte,</hi> and for its pleaſant Situation made choice of for the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Court and chief Place of Reſidence. It lies almoſt Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or (as <hi>Herbert</hi> ſaith) Semi-Circular, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſtrong Walk of Free-Stone, and a Moat of a hundred Paces broad. The Circumference of the City is reckon'd to be twelve <hi>German</hi> Miles. The Streets, which are very ſtraight, are dirty, and three Leagues and a half long.</p>
               <p>In the Northern part of the City, not far from the River, lies, the great and famous Royal Caſtle,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63517:171"/>or Reſidence of the Kings, which is the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and glorious Piece of Work in all <hi>Aſia.</hi> It appears outwardly like a City, containing five hundred and twenty Paces in circumference. The Structure is for the moſt part built of Free-ſtone, with many Galleries and Piazzaes, very ſtately, after the manner of the Country.</p>
               <p>At the Entrance of this Caſtle ſtands the Royal Court of Judicature, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Diwanchane;</hi> before which is a large ſquare <hi>Maidan</hi> or Plain, planted about with Trees; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Perſons of Quality in hot Weather walk to cool themſelves. In the middle of the Plain ſtands a Pole, having a Bird on the top of it, at which they ſhoot with Bows and Arrows.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to this Court ſtands a large ſquare Building call'd <hi>Karchanay Schah,</hi> that is, <hi>The King's Treaſure-houſe,</hi> with eight Arch'd Vaults, in which are kept the greateſt part of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Treaſure. Two of theſe Cellers are reported to be full of Gold, and two of Silver; in the ſeventh are kept Pearls, Gems, and other ſuch like Rarities; and in the eighth are contain'd all ſuch Preſents as are ſent from forein Princes by Ambaſſadors.</p>
               <p>Behind this Treaſury ſtands another large ſquare Palace, with a very delightful Garden, and is call'd <hi>Hara Michan,</hi> that is, <hi>The King's Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Lodgings;</hi> for in it are kept twelve hundred of the King's Concubines, which are guarded and waited upon by ſix hundred Eunuchs.</p>
               <p>Others deſcribe this Court thus: It is three or four Leagues in circumference, ſurrounded with ſtrong Walls of red Stone, and broad Moats with Draw-Bridges; it hath four Gates, one on the North, which is very ſtrong; the ſecond on the Weſt ſide, is call'd <hi>Citſery,</hi> near the <hi>Bezar</hi> or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Within this Gate is the King's Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, where he decides all Differences; and behind that is the King's Hall, the Seat of the Vice-Roys. Within this Gate is alſo a Street built full of Houſes, and about a Mile long. The third Gate, call'd <hi>Achabaerbederiwage,</hi> that is, <hi>The Gate of King Achbaer,</hi> lies on the South ſide, and and leads to the King's <hi>Derbaer,</hi> the Royal Throne, or inner Court; before which is a ſmall Court, ſurrounded with Golden Rails, and cover'd on the top with Carpets, to keep off the heat of the Sun; beyond it is a Gallery, in which ſtands the King's Throne, adorn'd with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and all ſorts of Precious Stones. No Perſon is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to approach this Place without being call'd, except the King's Sons (which ſtanding near him, cool him by continual fanning of him with Fans, in the Country Language call'd <hi>Pank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamh</hi>) and the Chief Secretary.</p>
               <p>Within the foremention'd Court none are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to enter but <hi>Ommirades</hi> or <hi>Omrahs,</hi> which are Dukes and great Lords.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to this Place hang golden Bells, which are rung by thoſe that have ſuſtain'd any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and are thereupon admitted to ſpeak to the King, to make their Complaints to him, but not without great danger, if their Cauſe be not juſt.</p>
               <p>In this Place the King appears every After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, between three and four a Clock, beſides thouſands of other People, which take their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according to their Qualities, and with the King ſtay there till the Evening, hearing all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Letters, which are read by the Setretary, and determining all other Buſineſſes. Hither are alſo brought his Horſes and Elephants, which are try'd by ſome of his Servants appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Within this third Gate is likewiſe a <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> cover'd with a golden Roof.</p>
               <p>The fourth Gate call'd <hi>Eerſame,</hi> leads to a River, along whoſe Banks ſtands a beautiful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where the King Salutes the Riſing-Sun every Morning, whilſt the moſt eminent Perſons of his Court ſtanding on a riſing Ground, ſhew him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and the <hi>Hadys</hi> or Commanders of Horſe, with other People, remain in the outward Court, not daring to come any farther, unleſs they are call'd. From hence alſo he beholds the Fighting with Elephants, Lions, Buffalo's, and other wild Beaſts, which is perform'd every Day at Noon, except on Sundays.</p>
               <p>In the inner Hall of the Royal Court come no People but the King's Eunuchs or Bed-chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are call'd <hi>Godia.</hi>

For travelling Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others, there are eighty <hi>Serrais</hi> or <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravanſeraes,</hi> which are large ſquare Courts, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with high Stone Walls, at each end whereof ſtands a Watch-Tower, out of which they go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeveral Galleries, wherein are Lodging-Rooms, each of them having Doors to lock, and alſo Chimneys; there are commonly two or three Rooms one over another. Under theſe Chambers are great Arch'd Stables for Horſes, Aſſes, Oxen, and Camels; and in the midſt of the Yard ſtands a Spring with running Water, or a Vault with ſtanding Water; they were built by the great <hi>Mogol Ekbar,</hi> after he had conquer'd the Kingdom of <hi>Surratte,</hi> and is ſaid to have coſt him two Millions and a half of <hi>Ropias,</hi> a <hi>Ropia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valu'd at 2 s. <hi>Sterl.</hi>

               <p>About the Year 1620. the City of <hi>Agra</hi> was by the <hi>Sultan Chorrom, Selim</hi>'s Son, ruin'd and plunder'd a ſecond time with far greater cruelty of the Soldiers than formerly, perhaps in revenge for the Loſs which they ſuſtain'd before the Caſtle, which they Storming in vain, loſt many Men, who were ſlain by the Beſieged.</p>
               <p>Between <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Lahor</hi> is a Walk planted with Trees four hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles in length, and is by Travellers, who refreſh themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cool ſhading Trees, accounted one of the moſt delightful Places in the whole World, there being ſeveral brave Houſes for Entertainment built along the High-way.</p>
               <p>A League and a half from <hi>Agra,</hi> on the Way from <hi>Lahor,</hi> is a Place call'd <hi>Tzekander,</hi> where the <hi>Great Mogol Ekbar</hi> erected a great Burying-place for himſelf and his Succeſſors; to which his Son <hi>Jangheer</hi> contributed very largely: and though there had been above twenty four Millions of <hi>Ropias</hi> beſtow'd on the ſame, yet it was not near finiſh'd in the Year 1626. The whole Structure is of hewn Stone, divided into four large Squares, each three hundred Paces: at the Corners of each ſtands a little Tower of colour'd Marble. It lies in the midſt of a very fine Garden, ſurrounded with a Wall of red Stone, within which is a Turret, from which you ſee into a little, but exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Garden.</p>
               <p>The City <hi>Fettipore,</hi> or <hi>Fatipor,</hi> by <hi>Jarrick</hi> call'd <hi>Fateful</hi> or <hi>Pateful,</hi> by <hi>Cowert, Fetterbat,</hi> and by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Fettipour,</hi> was anciently call'd <hi>Tzikkerim,</hi> or <hi>Sykary,</hi> and lies twelve <hi>Kours,</hi> or four Leagues from <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City was upon the following occaſion built by the <hi>Great Mogol Ekbar, viz.</hi> At his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Aſmer,</hi> whether he went to viſit the Tomb of <hi>Mandy,</hi> he viſited St. <hi>Derwis,</hi> or a poor Monk call'd <hi>Seid Selim,</hi> that is, <hi>Seid Selim,</hi> who accounted himſelf highly honor'd, that God had employ'd him to tell <hi>Ekbar,</hi> that in a ſhort time he ſhould be the Father of three beautiful Children; and indeed <hi>Ekbar</hi> to acknowledge the Kindneſs, would have his eldeſt Son call'd <hi>Selim,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Chan Morad,</hi> or <hi>Amurath,</hi> and the third <hi>The Haen Schach,</hi> or <hi>Daniel:</hi> nay, this Prophecy was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to <hi>Ekbar,</hi> that he caus'd a fair <hi>Moſque</hi> to be built there, and inclos'd both that and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City <hi>Tzikerim</hi> or <hi>Sykary,</hi> with a high Wall, and from that time caus'd it to be call'd <hi>Fettipore,</hi> that is, <hi>A Place of Delight:</hi> nay, his Affections were ſo ſtrongly inclin'd to this City, that he built a Palace there, and alſo a <hi>Bazar</hi> or Exchange, the faireſt in all the Eaſtern Parts, reſolving far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make it the Metropolis of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for which it ſtood very convenient, being ſeated on the Bank of a River; yet the unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of the Air forc'd him to leave the ſame: ſince which time it is become a ruin'd and deſolate Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Cower</hi> affirms, that this City is much bigger than <hi>London,</hi> and is adorn'd with a Temple very artificially built, though much decay'd.</p>
               <p>The whole Tract of Land between this City and <hi>Agra,</hi> is always throng'd with People like a Market.</p>
               <p>The City <hi>Bian</hi> is four Leagues from <hi>Fatipor;</hi> beyond which are the Towns <hi>Ladana, Moſabadan,</hi> and <hi>Bandaſon;</hi> next lie <hi>Aſmeer</hi> or <hi>Eſmeer,</hi> where the <hi>Great Mogol Ekbar</hi> had a large Houſe or Stable, in which he commonly kept ſix hundred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and a thouſand Horſes.</p>
               <p>The City <hi>Aſmeer</hi> lies in 35 Degrees and 15 Minutes Northern Latitude, on a high and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible Mountain, twenty five Leagues from <hi>Agra.</hi> The greateſt part of the City lies at the foot of the Mountain, well built, but ill fortifi'd; notwithſtanding the Wall is of good Stone. A Prophet, one of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Diſciples, lies buried there in a ſtately Tomb, to which belong three pleaſant Yards, pav'd with Free-ſtone, poliſh'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner.</p>

               <p>At every half Leagues diſtance between <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Aſmeer,</hi> ſtands a Pillar or Column, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe which the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd to erect at the diſtance of a thouſand Paces. At the end of every
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63517:172"/>twenty five Mile there is an Inn or Place of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for Men and Horſe, where certain Women conſtantly give their attendance, and get ready ſuch Victuals for every one as they deſire; for which, and their Horſe-meat, they pay Three pence.</p>
               <p>There are alſo fair Houſes at every ten Miles diſtance, which were built by the <hi>Great Mogol Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> for the convenience of his Women, when he took a Journey to <hi>Aſmeer</hi> to viſit the Tomb of <hi>Mandy, Mahomet</hi>'s Diſciple.</p>
               <p>The whole Country being water'd by the Stream of <hi>Jemna,</hi> aboundeth with Corn, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Cherries, Pears, Apples, Plums, and other Fruit; amongſt which are Grapes, which being preſerv'd, are as big as <hi>Damas</hi> Pruins.

Saltpetre is likewiſe very plentiful here; and all ſorts of Poultry, Falcons, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Partridges, Hearns, and Wild-ducks. Here are alſo great ſtore of Goats, Cows, and Hogs; and Fiſh in ſuch abundance, that Eighteen pence will purchaſe enough to feed three hundred Men.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Agra</hi> are generally kept four Markets, where beſides Proviſions, divers other Goods are ſold. From <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>China</hi> are Tranſported hither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Quantities of Gold and Silver Cloths, which though ſlighter, are yet dearer than thoſe of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this City, as alſo in <hi>Lahor,</hi> the Inhabitants drive a great Trade in <hi>Anil,</hi> or Indico; and at <hi>Bandaſon</hi> there is vaſt quantities of Courſe Wooll, Cotton, Lances, Bowes, Javelins, Swords, and other Arms.

               <p>In this City the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> keep a Factory for their <hi>Eaſt-India Company,</hi> who maintain four or five Perſons, which formerly made a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on Scarlet Cloth, great and ſmall Looking-glaſſes, and other Merchandiſes; and alſo by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Indico, which grows about <hi>Agra,</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Bianes,</hi> two days Journey from thence, whither travelling twice a Year, they have built a Lodge or Store-houſe there, where they buy in all thoſe Stuffs or Cloths which come from <hi>Jelapour</hi> and <hi>Laknau,</hi> about ſix or eight days Journey from <hi>Agra.</hi> But at this time it is ſaid the Gain is nothing ſo conſiderable; whether it be becauſe the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> drive that Trade themſelves; or becauſe <hi>Agra</hi> lies ſo far from <hi>Suratte,</hi> that one Accident or other doth generally befal their <hi>Caravans,</hi> which are conſtrain'd to travel by the City <hi>Amadabad,</hi> through the <hi>Raja's</hi> Country, to avoid the bad Ways and Mountains which lye on the ſide of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeor</hi> and <hi>Brampour,</hi> which is the ſhorteſt way.</p>

               <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Decan</hi> is, according to <hi>Juan de Baroes,</hi> generally taken for the whole Extent which the Country of <hi>Cuncan</hi> comprehends, becauſe the Inhabitants call that Tract of Land <hi>Cuncan</hi> which extends it ſelf along the Sea, from North to South, to the River <hi>Aliga;</hi> and from Eaſt to Weſt, from the Sea to the Mountains of <hi>Gate:</hi> So that theſe People are call'd <hi>Cuncanyns.</hi> and not, as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſtile them, <hi>Canariins.</hi> But the Coaſt of <hi>Decan,</hi> which extends Eaſtward to the Mountains of <hi>Gate,</hi> is call'd <hi>The Kingdom of Decan;</hi> and the Inhabitants, <hi>Decanyns:</hi> and, as <hi>Linſchot</hi> hath it, this Country is alſo call'd <hi>Ballagate,</hi> that is, <hi>The Upper Gate;</hi> for <hi>Balla</hi> ſignifies <hi>Upper,</hi> and <hi>Gate, A Mountain.</hi> Or rather the Country of <hi>Ballagate</hi> (by <hi>Ananie</hi> call'd <hi>Bilagate</hi>) is that Land which extends over and among thoſe Mountains; as appears by the Deſcription of <hi>Linſchot,</hi> who makes three Kingdoms of this Country, dividing it into <hi>Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Decan,</hi> and <hi>Cuncan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe three Countries, taken together, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the North at the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaye</hi> or <hi>Zurratte,</hi> with the Stream <hi>Bate</hi> between both, and alſo at the Kingdom of <hi>Orixa;</hi> on the Eaſt, at the Kingdom of <hi>Narſinge;</hi> on the Weſt, at the Sea; on the South, at <hi>Canara,</hi> being parted by the River <hi>Aliga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Country extends it ſelf along the Sea above 250 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles; or, as <hi>Ananie</hi> ſaith, full ſixty two <hi>German:</hi> that is, from the Mouth of the Stream <hi>Bate,</hi> to that of <hi>Aliga;</hi> or rather, as <hi>Juan de Baroes</hi> hath it, from <hi>Chaul</hi> to the River <hi>Aliga</hi> in <hi>Sintacora</hi> is ſixty five <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miles. But <hi>Texeira,</hi> and other Modern Writers, rightly diſtinguiſh the Country of <hi>Decan</hi> from that of <hi>Cuncan</hi> or <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> by its extent to the North, calling that Country <hi>Cuncan</hi> which extends to the South, and that which lies more to the North, and nearer to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baye, Decan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decan</hi> borders on the North at <hi>Cambaye,</hi> on the Eaſt, at the Mountain of <hi>Ballagate;</hi> on the South, at <hi>Cuncan;</hi> and on the Weſt, at the Sea. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from the South to the North along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt of <hi>Sifferdan</hi> to <hi>Negotana,</hi> a Tract of twenty Leagues, and runs up into the Country near <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Metropolis of <hi>Decan,</hi> according to <hi>Texeira,</hi> is call'd <hi>Hamedanager;</hi> by <hi>Ananie,</hi> and ſome others, ſingly <hi>Danager;</hi> by others, <hi>Amdadanager,</hi> who place it up in the Country, and make it the King's Reſidence, affirming, That he made this the Seat of his Realm, becauſe of the pleaſant Situation of the City, and the delightful Gardens about the ſame: Yet there are ſome that make <hi>Beder,</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> by <hi>Barboſa</hi> call'd <hi>Mavider,</hi> the Metropolis of all <hi>Decan,</hi> and Reſidence of the Kings. Next to this, is reckon'd the City of <hi>Decan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Kingdom lies alſo a City built near the Sea-ſhore, which <hi>Texeira</hi> calls <hi>Chaul;</hi> but <hi>Baroes,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63517:174"/>Chiaul;</hi> by <hi>Della Valle, Ciul,</hi> and <hi>Chaul;</hi> and by <hi>Barthema, Ceuul:</hi> which by <hi>Caſtald</hi> is taken for the ancient City <hi>Camane</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> It lies ten Leagues to the Southward of <hi>Bazzain,</hi> in 19 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 50 Minutes of Northern Latitude, two Leagues from the Sea, near a River, which by the help of the Flood coming from the Sea, brings up Ships cloſe to the Walls of the City: It runs up a great way into the Country, from whence it takes its Courſe, trending through Hills and Valleys, till it diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſpacious Haven in the midſt of the Bay below the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have two Forts here, whereof the one was built <hi>Anno</hi> 1520. by <hi>Diego Sequeira,</hi> who obtain'd leave of the King for it: The other built by the <hi>Moors,</hi> is on the other ſide of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Right hand when you enter into it. To the Southward of this Haven lies a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mountain, in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Il Morro di Ciul,</hi> that is, <hi>A Member of Ciul,</hi> which commands both the City and Harbor, having a Fortreſs built on the top, which is in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, and belong'd formerly to the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Decan,</hi> that is, to <hi>Nizam Schiah</hi> King or Lord over all the adjacent County.</p>
               <p>This Fortreſs was conquer'd by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who with diſcharging their Muſquets at an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant which was by the <hi>Moors</hi> plac'd to defend the Gate, with a great Chain in his Mouth, ſo frighted him, that he remov'd to one ſide, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> to creep under his Belly, and make themſelves Maſters of the Place. But others relate, that the Place was taken after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> When the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had firſt with a handful of People defeated a conſiderable Party of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and put them to flight, they retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Fort <hi>Il Morro di Ciul,</hi> where they thought to be ſecure from the fury of the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> but an Elephant being wounded in the Battel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring amongſt them towards the Fort, fell down dead at the entrance of the Gate, which then could not be ſhut againſt the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who by firing boldly upon their Oppoſers, ſoon made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Place, which ſince that time they have made much ſtronger, and by that means defended the City <hi>Chaul</hi> from the continual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the <hi>Moors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pyrard</hi> tells us, That there are two Cities call'd <hi>Chaul,</hi> in one of which inhabit abundance of Handicrafts and Tradeſmen. In this City is a famous Temple dedicated to the Goddeſs <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without the City is a Toll-houſe: Alſo the Chief Church of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſtands near the Sea-ſhore, not far from which is a Cloiſter of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Southward from <hi>Chaul,</hi> by the Sea, lies a Place by <hi>Barboſa</hi> call'd <hi>Banda,</hi> or <hi>Dando;</hi> but by <hi>Della Valle, Danda Rajiapori:</hi> Near this lies the City <hi>Ziffardan,</hi> or <hi>Zeferdani,</hi> the utmoſt Limits of the Kingdom of <hi>Decan.</hi> In the ſame Tract, towards <hi>Banda,</hi> is a Bay call'd <hi>Kelſi,</hi> the Country on the South ſide whereof is very Mountainous. In <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> is alſo a City call'd <hi>Petan,</hi> or <hi>Patan,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth abundance of fine Callico.</p>
               <p>The Country of <hi>Decan</hi> is very fertile, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all things in great plenty, and agrees in moſt things with that of <hi>Cuncan;</hi> and the Inhabitants alſo agree in their Conſtitutions, Habits, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living: Wherefore we will here give an accout of them promiſcuouſly, and at large.</p>
               <p>The Air at <hi>Chaul</hi> is more hot than cold. The Soil thereabouts plentifully produces all things except Raiſins, Nuts, and Cheſs-nuts. Oxen, Cows, and Horſes are here in great numbers. The Inhabitants of <hi>Decan</hi> are call'd <hi>Decanyns,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Cuncan, Cuncanyns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After what manner the Countries of <hi>Decan, Ballagate,</hi> and <hi>Cuncan,</hi> or <hi>Viſiagour,</hi> which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly under the Juriſdiction of one Prince, are become ſubject to ſeveral Lords, I ſhall here give this brief Account.</p>
               <p>About three hundred years ſince the King of <hi>Dely</hi> brought all the neighboring Kingdoms, but particularly thoſe of <hi>Decan, Cuncan,</hi> and <hi>Ballagate,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Goa,</hi> under his Subjection: At the ſame time when the Country of <hi>Cambaye</hi> was conquer'd by the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who treated the <hi>Reisboutes,</hi> Inhabitants or the Country, very tyrannically.</p>
               <p>The Kingdoms of <hi>Ballagate</hi> and <hi>Decan</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly govern'd by <hi>Heathen</hi> Kings, and inhabited by a mighty People, of which the <hi>Venaſars</hi> and <hi>Collers,</hi> the preſent Inhabitants, are Succeſſors. They joyn themſelves with the <hi>Reisboutes,</hi> and commit many Robberies, forcing Tribute from the Inhabitants of <hi>Decan</hi> and <hi>Ballagate,</hi> without being puniſh'd for the ſame by their King.</p>
               <p>After the King of <hi>Dely</hi> had made theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the <hi>Mogols</hi> took up Arms, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the greateſt part of <hi>Dely.</hi> About the ſame time there was an eminent Lord of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> who, to revenge himſelf of his King, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Bother to death unjuſtly, bereav'd him both of his Crown and Life, and afterwards fell into <hi>Dely,</hi> forc'd the <hi>Mogols</hi> to fly, and at the ſame time made himſelf Maſter of all the Country of <hi>Ballagate</hi> and <hi>Cuncan,</hi> extending to the Borders of <hi>Cambaye.</hi> But he not being capable of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Countries, and being alſo deſirous of q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Houſe or Palace ſtands yet at <hi>Goa,</hi> but is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a Houſe of Inquiſition. The Place ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Great Church and the ſaid Houſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63517:174"/>bears the Name of <hi>Sabayo. Idalcan,</hi> who Reign'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1535. was Grandſon to one of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Kings.</p>
               <p>After this Diviſion thus made, there was a Quarrel between <hi>Idalcan</hi> and the King of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinga,</hi> his Neighbor; who by his Power ſubduing <hi>Idalcan,</hi> and the other Kings of <hi>Decan,</hi> made them Tributaries to him: But in proceſs of time <hi>Idalcan,</hi> or his Succeſſors, ſubdu'd all thoſe Countries which were poſſeſs'd by peculiar Kings or Lords, except that of <hi>Melik,</hi> which the <hi>Mogol</hi> had conquer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F. Bernier</hi> relates, That all this great Iſland of <hi>Hindoſlan,</hi> reckoning from the Bay of <hi>Cambay</hi> to that of <hi>Bengale,</hi> near <hi>Jagannate,</hi> and from thence to the Cape of <hi>Comori,</hi> was all, ſome Mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parts onely excepted, about two hundred years agoe under one particular Lord or King, who was a very great and Powerful Prince: But at preſent it is divided into many Dominions; and the People are likewiſe of ſeveral Religions. The Reaſon of this Diviſion was as followeth. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Raja</hi> or King, nam'd <hi>Ramras,</hi> the laſt of thoſe which Reign'd abſolute in this Country, impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently promoted three of his Slaves to too great Dignities, by making them Governors: <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt he made Governor of a great part of that Country which the <hi>Mogol</hi> at preſent poſſeſſes in <hi>Decan,</hi> round about <hi>Daulet-Abad,</hi> from <hi>Bider, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi> and <hi>Surratte,</hi> to <hi>Narbadar:</hi> To the ſecond he gave the Government of all thoſe Countries which are now comprehended in the Kingdom of <hi>Viſiapour;</hi> and to the third, that Part which is known by the name of the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda.</hi> Theſe three Slaves growing very Rich and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and being ſupported by many <hi>Mogols</hi> which were in the Service of <hi>Ramras,</hi> and of the ſame Religion with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> agreed together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt and kill their Lord and Benefactor; which having effected, they return'd into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Dominions, each of them taking upon him the Title of <hi>Schah,</hi> or <hi>King.</hi> The Succeſſors of <hi>Ramras</hi> finding themſelves not able to engage in a War againſt theſe Uſurpers, were content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſeat themſelves in a Place call'd <hi>Carnateck</hi> or <hi>Biſnaguer,</hi> where to this day they Reign as <hi>Rajas</hi> or Kings. The three Slaves and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors defended their Kingdoms very valiantly, ſo long as they agreed among themſelves, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting one another, maintain'd great Wars againſt the <hi>Mogols;</hi> but when they went about to defend their ſeveral Countries, they were immediately ſenſible of their Diviſion, to their great prejudice, being ſoon after reduc'd under the Subjection of the <hi>Mogols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decan</hi> belong'd formerly to a peculiar King; but is at preſent Govern'd by one of the <hi>Great Mogol</hi>'s Vice-Roys.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great Mogol Akebar,</hi> or <hi>Ecbar,</hi> was the firſt which conquer'd the Kingdom or Country of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> He ſent his Son, <hi>Sultan Morad, Anno</hi> 1595. againſt <hi>Melik Amber,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Decan,</hi> to whom belong'd formerly the City of <hi>Chaul,</hi> who ſetting forth from <hi>Cambaye,</hi> as being the neareſt Place to this Province, was kill'd, with many of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. After this, in the Year 1598. he ſent one of his youngeſt Sons to maintain the Wars againſt <hi>Melik,</hi> and revenge the Death of <hi>Sultan Morad:</hi> And ſoon after he follow'd in his own Perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to be preſent at the Conqueſt; but he ſtaid about a Year in the City of <hi>Agra,</hi> from whence he march'd, <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. to the Kingdom of <hi>Decan:</hi> But the Queen of <hi>Decan,</hi> who Reign'd at that time, being a Woman of great Spirit and Valour, and being alſo aſſiſted by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> and ſome great Lords, oppos'd him with ſo much Courage and Reſolution, that many of his People were ſlain at their entrance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Barara,</hi> at a Paſs near the Mountains, by which they were to come into the Country of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:</hi> Yet nevertheleſs the <hi>Decanyns,</hi> after the death of this Princeſs, divided themſelves into divers Parties, from which proceeded their overthrow and total ſubduction; for ſome being corrupted by Money, and others by Promiſes, they all, upon hopes of greater Employments, contributed their Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> in his Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Decan.</hi> Having by this means at laſt added this Kingdom to his Territories, he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one of his Sons to be his Vice-Roy, leaving with him a conſiderable Garriſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Texeira</hi> ſays the King of <hi>Decan</hi> was formerly by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Nezal al Malucho,</hi> that is, <hi>The Lance or Spear of the Kingdom,</hi> and alſo <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> or <hi>Melik,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>King. Della Valle</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that the right Name of the Kings of <hi>Decan</hi> is <hi>Nizam Sciah,</hi> which ſome tranſlate <hi>King of the Spear,</hi> induc'd thereunto by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Word <hi>Nize,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>A Spear;</hi> but falſly, becauſe the King calls himſelf <hi>Nizam Sciah,</hi> and not <hi>Nize Sciah,</hi> as this explanation requires. Others call him, according to the ſignification of the Word <hi>Nizam, King of Falcons;</hi> for <hi>Nizam</hi> in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue ſignifies <hi>A Falcon, or other Bird of Prey;</hi> becauſe this King, before he was made a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, was perhaps Falconer to that Great King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Juriſdiction all this Country was; ſo that he retains that Name to this day.</p>
               <p>The King which Reign'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. being a Child of about twelve Years of age, gave the Government of his Realm to one of his Slaves, call'd <hi>Melik Amber,</hi> by Extract an <hi>Ambaſſine,</hi> and of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, who Govern'd with ſo much Policy, that this Country was more known by the Name of <hi>The Dominion of Melik,</hi> than that of the Kingdom of <hi>Nizam Sciah.</hi> He Govern'd with great Fidelity, and Obedience to the King, and not as ſome pretended, like a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: Neither did he keep the King as a Priſoner, though it is ſaid by ſome that he deſign'd to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Daughter to the young King, that ſo he might the better hold his Governor-ſhip, and make his Heir his Succeſſor. He was a Man of great Prudence and Underſtanding, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Name of being very wicked, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Sorcery, of which ſome affirm he made uſe to continue himſelf in his Princes Favor. It is alſo ſaid, That for the accompliſhing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns he would offer to the Devil ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Children that were his Slaves, with abundance of other People, hoping thereby the more eaſily to obtain his Deſires. Theſe and other ſuch barbarous Wickedneſſes and Impieties have been reported of him.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Melik Amber</hi> maintain'd at that time great Wars againſt the <hi>Mogols,</hi> not ſparing his own Perſon, but himſelf engaging often very valiantly.</p>

               <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Cuncan</hi> is by <hi>Linſchot</hi> call'd <hi>The Kingdom of Dialcan;</hi> and by others, from <hi>Viſiapour</hi> its Metropolis, <hi>The Kingdom of Viſiapour;</hi> and by <hi>Della Valle, The Country of Telengone,</hi> or <hi>Telanga.</hi> It takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning on the Sea-ſhore of <hi>Ingediva,</hi> or <hi>Angedive,</hi> twelve Leagues Southward from <hi>Goa;</hi> or, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>John de Barros,</hi> from the River <hi>Aliga</hi> in <hi>Sintacora,</hi> which is a Boundary between <hi>Cuncan</hi> and the Country of <hi>Canara,</hi> and extends Northwardly to the Land of <hi>Decan,</hi> or the Land of <hi>Siffardan,</hi> a Tract of ſixty Leagues: Weſtward it runs to the Sea, and Eaſtward to the Mountains of <hi>Gate,</hi> or to the Kingdom of <hi>Bagenael,</hi> or <hi>Golconda;</hi> and is by a Stream ſeparated from the Iſland <hi>Goa. Della Valle</hi> makes <hi>Telengone,</hi> the Metropolis of this Kingdom, to border Southerly next that which belongs to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in <hi>Goa.</hi> Some reduce the City <hi>Viſiapour</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi> under the Province of <hi>Daman,</hi> and place the Province of <hi>Telanga</hi> much further, to the Southern part. The moſt eminent Sea-Towns are, <hi>Geytapour, Raſapoue, Carapatan,</hi> and <hi>Dabul;</hi> beſides which, there are ſeveral other very good Bays, Rivers, and Roads.</p>
               <p>The Chief City of this Kingdom, the Court and Reſidence of the Kings, is call'd <hi>Vaſiapour, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zapor,</hi> and <hi>Viſipor,</hi> or peculiarly <hi>Vidhikpor;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Linſchot</hi> places the King's Court at <hi>Solapor:</hi> but it is probable he keeps his Court ſometimes at the one, and ſometimes at the other. <hi>Viſiapour</hi> lies up into the Country about 30 <hi>Gau,</hi> (each <hi>Gau</hi> being three Leagues) or 90 <hi>German</hi> Miles from <hi>Dabul,</hi> and 25 from <hi>Goa.</hi> It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with high Walls of hard Stone, and deep Moats, which nevertheleſs are dry in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>Travelling from <hi>Viſiapour</hi> to <hi>Dabul,</hi> you paſs through theſe Cities: From <hi>Nouraſpour</hi> you come to the City of <hi>Sirrapour</hi> and <hi>Tickota,</hi> ſix <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Viſiapour:</hi> Three <hi>Kos</hi> beyond <hi>Tickota</hi> is the City <hi>Honnowaere;</hi> and three more beyond that, a City call'd <hi>Caleſen:</hi> Six <hi>Kos</hi> further is a great and Trading Town nam'd <hi>Atteny,</hi> two days Journey from <hi>Viſiapour:</hi> Four <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Caleſen,</hi> and two from <hi>Atteny,</hi> between both, lies the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>Burgie;</hi> and two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Atteny,</hi> the great Dorp <hi>Agelle:</hi> Six <hi>Kos</hi> and a half from <hi>Atteny</hi> is the City <hi>Areka,</hi> with two <hi>Bary,</hi> or Villages, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſide of the Road, about four <hi>Kos</hi> and a half from <hi>Areka,</hi> and one and a half from <hi>Atteny.</hi> Three <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Areka</hi> lies the City <hi>Berek,</hi> with a ſmall Village in the way, one <hi>Kos</hi> and a half from <hi>Areka,</hi> and is under the Juriſdiction of the City <hi>Miriſdie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miriſdie,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Mirdſy,</hi> is a large and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late City, fortified on the South-weſt ſide with a ſtrong Caſtle, which is ſo well furniſh'd with Men and Amunition, that the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> after the conquering of many Towns and Fortreſſes, could not ſubdue this Caſtle with his whole Army. It is adorn'd with a <hi>Metzid,</hi> built after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> manner, in which lie buried two Kings of <hi>Dely,</hi> which died about 500 Years ago; their Graves being adorn'd with Hangings, and other rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, are frequented by the Inhabitants, and travelling People, who ſhew great Reverence to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Mirdſy</hi> lies the Village <hi>Epour;</hi> and three <hi>Kos</hi> further, on the Banks of the River <hi>Koecenna,</hi> are two Towns, the one call'd <hi>Great,</hi> and the other <hi>Little Graeen,</hi> about a Cannon-ſhot one from another. Five Leagues and a half-from the River <hi>Koecenna</hi> is the great and rich Trading City <hi>Aſta,</hi> with the Villages <hi>Toncaa</hi> and <hi>Aſtacka,</hi> in the Road, about two <hi>Kos</hi> and a half one from the other; between which two Villages is a <hi>Barry</hi> or Hamlet. Three <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Aſta</hi> ſtands the large and well-built City <hi>Ballouwa;</hi> and three <hi>Kos</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, two Towns, about a Cannon-ſhot one from the other, call'd <hi>Oerem</hi> and <hi>Jeſſelampour;</hi> the laſt of which hath a ſtrong Caſtle, with high Walls, wherein the Governor for the King of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> hath his Reſidence. Two <hi>Kos</hi> from thence is a Village nam'd <hi>Taffet;</hi> and three <hi>Kos</hi> further, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call'd <hi>Caſsegam;</hi> and two beyond that, the decay'd City <hi>Caljaer.</hi> Two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Caljaer</hi> is the Village <hi>Galoure;</hi> and ſix <hi>Kos</hi> beyond that, the City <hi>Tamba,</hi> and Village <hi>Winge,</hi> near the City <hi>Quelampour;</hi> and another Town call'd <hi>Domo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The City <hi>Tamba</hi> is large, and well Peopled, built along a Running Water which hath its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal out of the River <hi>Coyna.</hi> Two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Tamba</hi> is the Village <hi>Morel;</hi> two beyond that, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera;</hi> and four <hi>Kos</hi> further, <hi>Beloure:</hi> two more from hence lies a great Village call'd <hi>Werad,</hi> nine Leagues from the <hi>Ballagatean</hi> Mountains. Not far from this place is the Village <hi>Patan,</hi> formerly the Reſidence of a famous Robber call'd <hi>Hiewogy,</hi> who forc'd Tribute from all Travellers, which none could hinder him from, notwithſtanding all poſſible means were us'd to prevent it; for ſo ſoon as any Forces were ſent againſt him, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fled into the Mountains, which were natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inacceſſible. Another Village, call'd <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waek,</hi> lies about three <hi>Kos</hi> beyond <hi>Werad,</hi> by which runs the River <hi>Coyna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three great <hi>Kos,</hi> or a League and a half from the River <hi>Coyna,</hi> on the Mountains of <hi>Ballagate,</hi> is the Village <hi>Gatamata,</hi> ſo call'd in reſpect of theſe Mountains; for <hi>Gata</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>A Mountain,</hi> and <hi>Mata, Above,</hi> or <hi>On the top.</hi> Three <hi>Kos</hi> further lies another Village call'd <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> at the foot of the foremention'd Mountains, which by reaſon of their ſteep, narrow, and Rocky Ways, are very troubleſom to travel. Two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Poly,</hi> or the Foot of the <hi>Ballagatean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, is the Village <hi>Combaerly;</hi> and ſixteen <hi>Kos</hi> from thence, at the River <hi>Ghaybeer,</hi> a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage nam'd <hi>Chipolone,</hi> from whence is a paſſage by Water to the City <hi>Dabul.</hi> All Goods that come out of the Country of <hi>Decan,</hi> are carried in Boats from thence to <hi>Dabul,</hi> and ſo farther up into the Country, which makes this Place to be very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and plentifully ſtored with all manner of Proviſions. The Merchandiſes and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are brought thither by Water, pay for each <hi>Kandy,</hi> or 450 Pound weight, one <hi>Laryn</hi> and a half Freight to <hi>Dabul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Four <hi>Gau,</hi> or twelve Leagues from <hi>Chipolone,</hi> down the River <hi>Helewacko,</hi> lies the City <hi>Dabul,</hi> or <hi>Dabrul,</hi> anciently very famous, but of late much ruin'd by the Wars, and decreas'd in Trade. It lies in 18 Degrees Northern Latitude, or, as others affirm, in 17 Degrees 45 Minutes, and is built along the Shore of the River <hi>Helewacko,</hi> ten Leagues from <hi>Chaul.</hi> It lies open onely on the South-ſide which fronts the Water, where are two Batteries planted with four Iron Guns. On the Mountains are ſeveral decay'd Fortreſſes, and an ancient Caſtle, but without any Guns or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. On the Northern Point, where the Bay begins, ſtands a little Wood, which at a diſtance appears like a Fort; and below this Wood, near the Water, is a white Temple, or <hi>Pagode;</hi> as alſo another on the South Point, on the declining of the Mountain, beſides ſeveral other Temples and ſtately Edifices. This City was taken from the King of <hi>Idalcan,</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe, Anno</hi> 1508. but was afterwards won from them again, and ruin'd by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Leagues Southward from <hi>Dabul</hi> lies a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory or Cape by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call'd <hi>Dabul Falſo,</hi> that is, <hi>Falſe Dabul,</hi> becauſe in ſailing by the ſame they often find themſelves deceiv'd, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for the Point of <hi>Dabul,</hi> which it very much reſembles. Beyond this Cape is a Bay by them call'd <hi>Enceada de los Brahmannes,</hi> that is, <hi>The Bay of the Brahmines,</hi> becauſe many <hi>Brahmines</hi> dwell thereabouts. Beyond this is the <hi>Ragiaputa,</hi> and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63517:178"/>the Cape <hi>Caraputa;</hi> the <hi>Enceada,</hi> or Sea-Bay <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſi,</hi> or <hi>Caleſci,</hi> lying not far from the Cape <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peta;</hi> and next to that, <hi>Tambona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Four Leagues from <hi>Dabul</hi> lieth the Bay of <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizara,</hi> in 17 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude. Twelve Leagues from <hi>Zanguizara,</hi> or rather from <hi>Dabul,</hi> and twenty from <hi>Goa,</hi> lies the Haven and Road of <hi>Ceitapour,</hi> in 17 Degrees and 20 Minutes Northern Latitude, behind an Iſland which ſecures it from all Winds. This Haven hath at the loweſt but three, and at the higheſt not above ſix or ſeven Fathom Water. Beyond the River, three Leagues from this Iſland and the Road <hi>Ceitagour,</hi> lies the City <hi>Raſapour,</hi> one of the eminenteſt Towns of the Kingdom of <hi>Cuncan</hi> and <hi>Viſiapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Travelling from the Sea-ſide about <hi>Goa,</hi> up into the Country, to the Metropolis <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> you paſs by and through the following Cities and Villages. Firſt, A great City call'd <hi>Ditcauly,</hi> lying three <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Goa.</hi> Not far from thence, near the River <hi>Madre de Dios,</hi> lies a Caſtle call'd <hi>Ponda. Banda,</hi> a mighty City, is about one <hi>Gau,</hi> or three Leagues from <hi>Ditcauly,</hi> two from <hi>Goa,</hi> two from <hi>Wingerla,</hi> and three and a half, or nine Leagues from <hi>Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> It is built near the River <hi>Dery,</hi> which glides by this City into the Sea, having broad Streets, with many fair Buildings, and ſeveral <hi>Pagodes</hi> or Temples.</p>
               <p>Between <hi>Banda</hi> and the <hi>Ballagatean</hi> Mountains lie ſeveral Villages; as <hi>Amby,</hi> two <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> and <hi>Herpoli,</hi> four <hi>Kos:</hi> Eleven <hi>Kos</hi> from thence, on the other ſide, at the Foot of the loweſt of the <hi>Ballagatean</hi> Mountains, is the Village <hi>Amboly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which, near the River <hi>Herenecaſſy,,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Village of the ſame Name. A Cannon-ſhot from <hi>Herenecaſſy,</hi> in the Valley between the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Ballagate,</hi> is a Dorp call'd <hi>Berouly;</hi> and two <hi>Kos</hi> further, another call'd <hi>Weſeree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> three <hi>Kos</hi> further, <hi>Outor;</hi> ſix and a half more, <hi>Berapour;</hi> half a <hi>Kos</hi> beyond, <hi>Matoura;</hi> and one more, the pleaſant Village <hi>Calingra,</hi> cloſe planted about with Trees. A Cannon-ſhot from <hi>Calingra</hi> is the Village <hi>Cangier,</hi> a little beyond a place by a general Name call'd <hi>Bary;</hi> for all thoſe Places which have no peculiar Name, but belong to other Villages, are in general call'd <hi>Bary.</hi> One <hi>Kos</hi> from hence lies the Village <hi>Worry;</hi> and two and a half further, another call'd <hi>Attrowaad,</hi> adorn'd with a <hi>Pagode</hi> built on a Mountain, which may be ſeen at a conſiderable diſtance. Two <hi>Kos</hi> and a half fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lies the Village <hi>Badaraly;</hi> and as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, the Dorp <hi>Kerwes;</hi> two <hi>Kos</hi> more from which is <hi>Secoery:</hi> Five <hi>Kos</hi> from hence is a <hi>Pagode,</hi> from whence you may plainly ſee the City <hi>Mirſie,</hi> with its Caſtles and Towers. Seven <hi>Kos</hi> from the Village <hi>Secoery</hi> lies <hi>Raiabaeg,</hi> a pretty large and Trading In-land City, fortified with a Caſtle, and belonging properly to the King's Conſort: About one <hi>Kos</hi> from the City is a fair Well, and two <hi>Kos</hi> further runs the River <hi>Gagni.</hi> Three <hi>Kos</hi> and a half from this City of <hi>Raiabaag,</hi> is another City call'd <hi>Gotterny,</hi> which hath a Fortification at one of its Gates. A Cannon-ſhot from thence are two Villages, call'd <hi>Coeteſy</hi> and <hi>Omgar;</hi> and half a <hi>Kos</hi> further, the eminent River <hi>Corſtena;</hi> one <hi>Kos</hi> and a half from which is the Village <hi>Eynatour;</hi> beyond that, the Dorp <hi>Caterna;</hi> and one <hi>Kos</hi> and a half further, the River <hi>Agery,</hi> with the Villages <hi>Tangely</hi> and <hi>Erary.</hi> Three <hi>Kos</hi> from <hi>Erary</hi> is the City <hi>Atteny;</hi> and one <hi>Kos</hi> beyond, the City <hi>Bard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;</hi> from whence to <hi>Agger</hi> is three <hi>Kos</hi> and a half more; three <hi>Kos</hi> thence to the City <hi>Talſenge;</hi> and as much from thence to <hi>Hamowaere: Tickocata</hi> lies three <hi>Kos</hi> further, and about ſix from <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> having <hi>Nouraſpour</hi> and <hi>Sirrapour</hi> between both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tickocata</hi> is an In-land City, provided with a large <hi>Sarry</hi> or Publick Inn for Travellers.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Cuncan</hi> is water'd by ſeveral Rivers: <hi>viz.</hi> A little to the Northward of <hi>Goa</hi> is the River <hi>Madre Dios;</hi> and beyond the City <hi>Banda</hi> the River <hi>Dery</hi> falls into the Sea, and is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable in ſmall Veſſels. Two <hi>Kos</hi> from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Kaiabaag</hi> glides the River <hi>Corſtena,</hi> which paſſes through the whole Country of <hi>Cuncan,</hi> to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of <hi>Maſilipatan;</hi> about three <hi>Kos</hi> from whence, the Stream <hi>Agry</hi> hath its Courſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Towns <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little Graeen</hi> runs a large River call'd <hi>Coecenna,</hi> on whoſe Banks thoſe Towns are ſituate. The River <hi>Coyna,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Great Water,</hi> paſſing through the Village <hi>Helewaek,</hi> hath its Original near the City <hi>Chaury,</hi> lying twelve <hi>Gau,</hi> or thirty ſix Leagues up into the Country, and extends it ſelf in ſeveral Branches beyond the Metropolis <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> and the whole Kingdom of <hi>Cuncan.</hi> The River <hi>Ghayhkeer</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges its Water into the River <hi>Helewacko,</hi> whoſe Shore is border'd by many Dorps, and planted with <hi>Cocos</hi> and other Trees, very delightful to the Spectators. This River hath its riſe out of the Mountains of <hi>Ballagata,</hi> and poſſes by the City <hi>Eabul</hi> into the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, where it makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Bay. From the North to the South Point, croſs this Bay, is a Bank, which at low Water is quite dry; ſo that thoſe which ſail up the River to the City, muſt paſs along cloſe by the South Point. At the entrance is commonly five or ſix Fathom Water at low Tide. Four Leagues to the Southward of <hi>Dabul,</hi> and thirty to the Northward of <hi>Goa,</hi> glides the River <hi>Zangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> by <hi>Barboſa</hi> call'd <hi>Cinguicar:</hi> Its entrance into the Sea is in 17 Degrees and 13 Minutes Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Latitude, and makes a large Bay or In-let, with ſeveral commodious Roads for Shipping. Next is the River <hi>Bardes,</hi> which runs by a Town call'd <hi>Banda.</hi> The Stream <hi>Aliga</hi> of <hi>Sintacora,</hi> which riſes in the Mountains of <hi>Gate,</hi> from thence taking its Courſe to the Weſtward, falls into the Sea oppoſite to the Iſland <hi>Anchedive,</hi> in 14 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and a half of Northern Latitude.</p>
               <p>The many Rivers and Brooks which flow through this Country of <hi>Cuncan,</hi> make the ſame very fruitful, eſpecially in the production of Rice, which is ſow'd in ſuch Grounds as lie low, and are overflow'd in the Winter: Yet it produces but little Corn; but abundance of <hi>Areka</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> eſpecially on the Banks of the River <hi>Betel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fruit <hi>Mangas</hi> growing in <hi>Ballagate</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem'd, weighing about two Pound a spiece, and are of a much pleaſanter taſte than thoſe which grow in <hi>Charanna, Quindor, Mandanagor,</hi> and <hi>Dulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bado,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Niſamoxa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ballagate</hi> and <hi>Decan</hi> produce alſo abundance of Grapes, but inferior to thoſe of <hi>Spain;</hi> and alſo great Quantities of Cotton and Silk.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe divers ſorts of Stones found in <hi>Ballagate;</hi> as Amethyſts, Chryſolites, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathites, or Blood-ſtones; and by <hi>Decan,</hi> beyond <hi>Ballagate,</hi> very rich Diamonds are found on the Mountain which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call <hi>Rocca Velha,</hi> that is, <hi>The Old Rock.</hi> Some of theſe Precious Stones, which are cut naturally, are in the Country Language call'd <hi>Naiffez,</hi> and are by the <hi>Indians</hi> eſteem'd above all others.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:63517:178"/>
               <p>By <hi>Uſtabado</hi> is a certain Stone found by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> call'd <hi>Hageramini,</hi> and by the <hi>Portugueſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra Armenia,</hi> that is, <hi>The Armenian Stone;</hi> becauſe the ſame ſort, being of a blueiſh green, are found in <hi>Armenia.</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> make uſe of them in their Sickneſs to provoke Urine.</p>
               <p>About the Countries of <hi>Ballagate</hi> is a ſort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Varniſh: Here are alſo many Tygers, and Serpents of a prodigious length and bigneſs.</p>
               <p>The Natives of <hi>Decan</hi> and <hi>Cuncan</hi> are either <hi>Decangeans</hi> or <hi>Cuncanyns,</hi> and corruptly by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call'd <hi>Canaryns</hi> and <hi>Corumbyns;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are <hi>Moors, Perſians, Benjans,</hi> and other <hi>Heathen</hi> People, which far exceed the Natives in Number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Linſchot</hi> tells us, That the Inhabitants both in Complexion, Conſtitution, and Clothes, do very much reſemble thoſe of <hi>Zurratte,</hi> and the <hi>Benjans:</hi> But <hi>Barboſa</hi> makes them Black, and <hi>Barthema</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or Swarthy. They are naturally Valiant, being for the moſt part extracted from Strangers; excellent Horſe-men, and well skill'd in managing of Elephants: but they are very proud, inſolent, and ſelf-conceited. Their Women are much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Venery.</p>
               <p>Their Clothes are either of Silk or Cotton, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their Shoes, which are open at the Toes, and lac'd over their bare Feet on the top: yet <hi>Pyrard</hi> ſaith, That they are Red, ſharp-toe'd, gilt, and open on the top. The Women walk with their Faces veil'd, and the Children ſtark naked, till their ſeventh or eighth Year. They eat all things without diſtinction, except Cows, Hogs, and Buffaloes; which Beaſts according to an ancient Cuſtom of the <hi>Brahmines</hi> are accounted Holy; nay, they are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly grounded in this belief, that they ſleep a nights under theſe Beaſts, and catch their Dung in their Hands, imagining that thereby they do their Gods great Service. They alſo abſtain from all ſorts of Fiſh. Moſt of their Houſes are built of Straw, with ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Doors, that they are forc'd to creep in and out. Their Furniture is inconſiderable; for a Mat ſpread on the Ground ſerves them in ſtead of a Bed; and a Hole digg'd in the Earth, for a Mortar to ſtamp their Rice in.</p>
               <p>There are many Gold and Silver-ſmiths among them, and alſo very good Artiſts in the working of other Minerals, beſides many other Handicrafts and Tradeſmen, Phyſicians, Chirurgeons, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, Maſons, and the like. Every Child is taught the Trade or Calling of his Parents.</p>
               <p>The Ruſticks maintain themſelves with ſowing of Rice and Fiſhing, on which they live very poorly, inhabiting near the Sea-ſhore, and the Banks of Rivers, for the convenience of the <hi>Coco</hi>-Trees which grow along the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Decanders</hi> which dwell near the River <hi>Zanguizara</hi> maintain themſelves with Tillage and keeping of Cattel. People of more Ability Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in Pepper, in which the chiefeſt Trade of this Country conſiſts, which coming out of <hi>Canara,</hi> is ſent by Sea to <hi>Perſia, Suratte,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> They deal likewiſe in all ſorts of Proviſions; for this Country is the Store-houſe for all its Neighbors. The Inhabitants alſo drive a great Trade in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico, and another ſort of Cloth call'd <hi>Beirames,</hi> which being brought by Land from <hi>Indoſtan, Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Choromandel,</hi> is ſold to great advantage; for in moſt Towns are kept Weekly Markets, to which the Merchants carry all their Commodities, but eſpecially Corn and Proviſions, which are generally bought up by a valiant ſort of People call'd <hi>Veneſars,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported through the whole Country of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> which they penetrate with <hi>Cafilas</hi> conſiſting of three, four, nay ſometimes eight or ten thouſand Beaſts of Burthen, accompanied with Women and Children, which follow them like an Army.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Viſiapour</hi> dwell many Jewellers, which Trade in Diamonds that come from <hi>Golconda,</hi> and Pearls of a great value. There is alſo a great Market wherein nothing but Diamonds are ſold, which are bought by the <hi>Benjans</hi> of <hi>Surratte</hi> and <hi>Cambaye,</hi> and by them diſpos'd of again at <hi>Goa</hi> and other Places. Out of this Country is alſo carried great ſtore of <hi>Betel,</hi> to <hi>Ormus, Aden,</hi> and <hi>Cambaye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of <hi>Goa</hi> drive a great Trade with the Inhabitants of <hi>Cuncan,</hi> but chiefly with the Merchants of <hi>Ditcauly</hi> and <hi>Banda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the City of <hi>Raiebaag</hi> dwell many eminent Dealers, which Trade in Pepper and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>The Coins and Current Moneys of <hi>Cuncan</hi> are of different Valuations, there being two ſorts, <hi>viz. Laryns</hi> and <hi>Pagods.</hi> A <hi>Laryn</hi> of <hi>Dabul,</hi> coyn'd of the ordinary Metal, is valued at ten <hi>Pagods;</hi> whereas thoſe of <hi>Perſia</hi> make but eight. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Pagods</hi> are likewiſe of a different Value; for ſome are worth ſeven and a half or eight <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Laryns,</hi> and ten In-land. Their ſmall Money is of Copper, and is call'd <hi>Baſarucus</hi> and <hi>Payſas;</hi> two hundred and ten <hi>Baſarucus,</hi> and in ſome Places a hundred and eighty, make a <hi>Laryn;</hi> and twenty eight <hi>Payſas</hi> are of the ſame value.</p>
               <p>Every Town and Village hath for the moſt part a peculiar Coin and Value on their Money, in which is great deceit, eſpecially in <hi>Laryns</hi> and <hi>Pagods,</hi> which the ſubtle <hi>Benjans</hi> make ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Copper and other Metals, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtinguiſh'd from the good: Wherefore few will receive Money without the preſence of a <hi>Xaraf</hi> or Exchanger, who for a ſmall Reward looks over all the Money, and makes good the Damage, if there happens to be any bad Money among that which he receives: And if it be found that an Exchanger ſo entruſted as is before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, ſhall deſignedly put away bad Money, he is immediately condemn'd to have his Hands cut off, and all his Eſtate forfeited to the King; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, they practice it daily.</p>
               <p>The Weight of this Country is like that of <hi>Surrat,</hi> having onely ſome ſmall difference; for twenty ſeven <hi>Maons</hi> of <hi>Cuncan</hi> make but twenty <hi>Maons</hi> of <hi>Surrat.</hi> The ordinary <hi>Maon</hi> of forty <hi>Ceeres</hi> (a <hi>Ceer</hi> is ſixty <hi>Peyſſes</hi>) is about twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds, with which Weight they weigh all heavy Goods; and with another Weight call'd <hi>Goemy</hi> (each <hi>Goemy</hi> being twelve <hi>Maons</hi>) they weigh their Pepper. A <hi>Quintal,</hi> which is alſo a common Weight, makes four <hi>Maons;</hi> and five <hi>Quintals,</hi> or twenty <hi>Maons,</hi> one <hi>Candy,</hi> which is five hundred and forty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pound weight.</p>
               <p>There are many other Coins and Weights in uſe among them, which every Perſon in buying or ſelling of Goods agree upon at their pleaſure; but theſe before-mention'd are the moſt common, and generally us'd through all the Country.</p>
               <p>The Arms which the Inhabitants of <hi>Decan</hi> and <hi>Viſiapour</hi> uſe, both for Horſe and Foot, are broad Swords, Pikes, Lances, with a ſquare Iron at the end about a Span long, Bows and Arrows, Shields, Darts, which they throw with great dexterity at their Enemies: Their Defenſive Arms are Coats
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63517:179"/>of Mail, and Coats lin'd with Cotton, which they call <hi>Landa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hes.</hi> When they march into the Field, they carry with them Tents of Callico, under which they ſleep. They make uſe of Oxen to carry their Baggage. Their common way of Fighting is on Foot, though when they march, ſome walk, others ride on Horſes, and ſome on Elephants, of which the King keeps a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for that purpoſe. The King of <hi>Cuncan</hi> is ſaid to be very powerful, and able in a ſhort time to bring eighty thouſand, or as ſome ſay, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand armed Men into the Field, both Horſe and Foot: He keeps many <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Mogols</hi> conſtantly in his Service, which commonly enjoy the moſt eminent Places under him: He likewiſe maintains many valiant <hi>Raſepouts.</hi> There are four very eminent Caſtles or Fortreſſes in <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> known by the Names of <hi>Ponda, Perinda, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poure,</hi> and <hi>Bellegam Chapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King hath divers great Guns in his Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and about two hundred Cannons, Demi-Cannons, and Culverins. Round about the City and Caſtle-walls of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> are planted many ſmall Pieces, as Drakes, and the like.</p>
               <p>In the City of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> is a Copper Gun of an incredible bigneſs, its Chamber being large enough to contain above five hundred Pound of Powder: It was found in a conquer'd Caſtle call'd <hi>Perando,</hi> from whence it was convey'd to <hi>Viſiapour</hi> by ten Elephants, fourteen hundred Oxen, and an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of Men. The Founder of this Piece is reported to have been a <hi>Roman,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the ſame to make his Name Immortal, and that his Work might be admir'd by the whole World; which is the more talk'd of, becauſe after he had finiſh'd this prodigious Piece, he kill'd his own Son, and ſprinkled his Blood over it for an Offering. It hapned alſo, that whilſt this Gun was Caſting, <hi>Braman</hi> the King's Treaſurer coming to demand an Account of the Charge from the ſaid <hi>Roman,</hi> he caus'd a Fire to be made in the Pit wherein the ſaid Gun was Caſt, and throwing the ſaid <hi>Braman</hi> into it, bid him take an Account of the Fire which conſum'd the Silver and Copper. The News carried to the King by the Relations of the Deceaſed, he ſeem'd not at all concern'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, but rather diſpleas'd with the Complainants, telling them he never gave his Treaſurer any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to demand an Account.</p>
               <p>With this Cannon the King took an almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Caſtle call'd <hi>Salapoure,</hi> making a Breach in the Wall at the firſt Shot of fifteen Ells long, and at the next, batter'd down the whole ſide of the Wall; which ſo amaz'd the Beſieged, that without any further reſiſtance they ſurrendred the Caſtle. The Inhabitants relate many ſtrange and ridiculous things of this Gun, as that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Propheſied like the Oracle at <hi>Delphos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſpeak three ſorts of Languages, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Arabian, Perſian,</hi> and the peculiar Language of the Country, which differs from that of the other Provinces.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Decan, Cuncan,</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> ſpeak the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, which at the Princes Courts is as common as their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>They Betroth their Children at ſeven or eight Years of Age, and Marry them at twelve. They keep a continu'd Feaſt for fourteen days before the Wedding, concluding each day with the ſound of Drums and Trumpets. On the Wedding-day all the Relations walk ſeven times about a Fire made for that purpoſe, after which they hold the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage confirm'd. The Bride brings nothing to her Husband, ſave onely her Perſon, and a few Jewels of an inconſiderable value.</p>
               <p>They always burn the Bodies of the Deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if a Married Man dies, the Widow is oblig'd either to caſt her ſelf into the Fire with the Corps of her dead Husband, or to live the reſt of her days in infamy and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Cuncan</hi> is in the Country Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage entituled <hi>Adelcan,</hi> that is, <hi>The true Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;</hi> or <hi>Adel Scach,</hi> that is, <hi>Real Lord,</hi> or <hi>Lord of Juſtice:</hi> and by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> corruptly, <hi>Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> or <hi>Hialcam;</hi> by the <hi>Netherlanders, Adelchia;</hi> by others, <hi>Cadum Schach,</hi> or <hi>Schach Gean:</hi> He is alſo call'd <hi>Sabay,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord. Dotexara</hi> call'd that King from whom the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> took <hi>Goa, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byb Adelcan,</hi> that is, <hi>Ruler and King of Juſtice;</hi> and not <hi>Sabay dalcan,</hi> as we read in Hiſtory. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Della Valle,</hi> the King's Title, beſides his own Name, is <hi>Adil Sciah,</hi> or <hi>Idal Sciah,</hi> which, as ſome render it, ſignifies <hi>A Juſt King;</hi> for <hi>Adil</hi> in the <hi>Arabian</hi> ſignifies <hi>Juſt:</hi> But others maintain, that <hi>Adil,</hi> or <hi>Idal,</hi> which is an <hi>Indian</hi> Word, ſignifies <hi>A Key,</hi> and therefore muſt be call'd <hi>King of Keys,</hi> perhaps from the Office which formerly belong'd to this Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> The keeping of the Keys which lock'd up the Books that containd the Accounts of the Treaſures of the Mighty Kings of <hi>Biſnagar</hi> and <hi>Sceherbeder,</hi> unto whom this King and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther petty Princes were ſubject, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy related.</p>
               <p>The King keeps a ſplendid Court, and when he rides abroad is attended by all his Nobility, and a great number of Horſe and Foot, beſides many Elephants and Camels, and the ſound of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
               <p>The Kings eldeſt Son always ſucceeds his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Government, and maintains his Siſters till they are Married.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Adel Schiah,</hi> who deceas'd <hi>Anno</hi> 2586. Great-grandfather to the King <hi>Idelxa,</hi> took <hi>Goa</hi> twice from the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> but ſeeing at laſt that his Forces were not any longer able to oppoſe them, he entred into a League with them, on this Condition, That the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſhould keep in poſſeſſion the City and Iſland of <hi>Goa,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces, <hi>viz. Salſette</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>Goa,</hi> with ſixty ſeven Villages; the Country of <hi>Bardes,</hi> with twelve Villages; and the bordering Country of <hi>Tiſvary,</hi> with thirty Villages: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the King of <hi>Viſiapour</hi>'s Subjects ſhould peaceably and quietly Trade into all Parts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and on condition that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſhould not buy any Pepper in any other Place but in <hi>Goa,</hi> upon Forfeiture of their Ships and Goods. But theſe Articles were broke ſeveral times by the Kings of <hi>Viſiapour;</hi> yet the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Vice-Roy reſiding in <hi>Goa</hi> as often reconcil'd the Difference, by ſending Ambaſſadors with great Preſents to them.</p>
               <p>The Father of this preſent King maintain'd great Wars againſt the <hi>Portugueſe. Anno</hi> 1654. he ſent a Letter to the Governor of <hi>Batavia,</hi> the Lord <hi>John Maetzuiker,</hi> deſiring him to ſend a Fleet of twenty ſix Sail of Ships to <hi>Goa,</hi> to help him drive the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> from thence, and afterwards ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the ſame to his Army. The Letter, by reaſon of its unuſual Stile, will not be amiſs to be inſerted here. The Contents thereof are as follow.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:63517:179"/>

Send therefore, according to</hi> Abdulakiem<hi>'s Requeſt, a Fleet of twenty ſix Sail, well Mann'd with valiant Soldiers, and provided with Guns and Ammunition, or at leaſt as many Ships as you can procure, to fight againſt the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>at</hi> Goa, <hi>which Place you muſt endeavor to clear of thoſe People, and after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt thereof, deliver</hi> Goa <hi>to our Army. This done, you ſhall always remain in our Favor; and 'twill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down to your Honor and Glory: And whatever</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulakiem <hi>ſhall write to you concerning it, freely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the ſame, and do that which this</hi> Firman <hi>here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.

Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Stile, <hi>On the thirteenth of</hi> Auguſt, Anno 1654.</p>
               <p>The King likewiſe wrote another Letter to the ſame purpoſe, to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant call'd <hi>Leonard Johnſon,</hi> to whom alſo <hi>Abdulakiem</hi> wrote the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE Perſon whoſe Strength and Conduct is eſteem'd of amongſt the Great Ones, is Learned</hi> Johnſon, <hi>a</hi> Dutch <hi>Merchant, whoſe Prudence muſt continue for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How long hath your Excellence maintain'd the War of</hi> Ceilon, <hi>with the Expence of much Powder and Shot, and the loſs of many valiant Soldiers; which yet remains ſtill unconquer'd, becauſe the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>have always freſh Aid come to them? Now to take</hi> Goa, <hi>and to baniſh the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>out of his ſight, the King hath made me Commander of his Army, with which I am already come to the Borders of</hi> Salſeet. <hi>And ſince you were formerly enclin'd, when a good</hi> Firman <hi>or Letter was ſent to you from the King, to aſſiſt him againſt his Enemies, your good Intentions to ſerve his Majeſty were made known to the King, who thereupon order'd two</hi> Firmans <hi>to be ſent away,</hi> viz. <hi>One to the Perſon of Honor, Eminent, of Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Reſpected amongſt the Nobility of your Country,</hi> John Maetzuiker, <hi>Vice-Roy for the</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers <hi>in the</hi> Indies: <hi>And the other to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: Wherein is mention'd, That your Ships being well furniſh'd with Victuals and Ammunition, ſhould come hither according to my Directions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire you will ſend your Fleet with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition you can, well provided with all things, to the Bay of</hi> Goa: <hi>And when we have obtain'd the Victory, and routed the</hi> Portugueſe, <hi>we ſhall conſequently in few days be alſo Maſters of</hi> Ceilon; <hi>after which your Valour ſhall be renown'd in the King's Houſe, you ever continue in his Favor, and your Trade ſhall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in theſe Countries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If in caſe you cannot reſolve to this Propoſal, then conſider what Charge you may be at in this War, and what Loſs you think you may ſuſtain by it. You will not want much Ammunition in theſe Countries; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not refuſe ſending Aſſiſtance to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year, in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> a Peace was concluded between King <hi>Adel Schiah</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> whereby both Parties were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd free acceſs one to the other.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> maintains alſo Wars againſt ſome of his <hi>Rais</hi> or <hi>Rajas,</hi> which are <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Princes, or petty Kings, which with the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> their Subjects reſide in the Mountains of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagate,</hi> in Places naturally inacceſſible, where they neither fear being ſurpriz'd nor beſieg'd.</p>
               <p>They have no Written Laws in the whole Realm; but the King's Will is a Law to all his Subjects. All Civil Debates that happen to ariſe in the City <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> are determin'd by the <hi>Coutewael</hi> or High-Sheriff; but Criminal Cauſes are try'd by the King himſelf. The Criminals are often executed in the King's Preſence, with great cruelty, throwing them oftentimes before Elephants, and other Wild Beaſts, to be devour'd, and ſometimes cutting off their Arms, Legs, and other Members; beſides other ways not uſual in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In other Towns or Provinces the Vice-Roy or Governor paſſes Sentence after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For by vertue of their Patents, which they call <hi>Firman,</hi> they are particularly impower'd to give Judgment againſt Criminals. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly judge of theſe Cauſes according to the firſt Complaint which they hear; ſo that he which complains firſt, for the moſt part fares beſt. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Debt are ſoon decided among them; for if the Debtor do not pay his Creditor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time limited by the Judge, he is ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whipp'd, and his Wife and Children ſold for Slaves by the Creditor. Such Perſons as are forc'd to ſwear, are plac'd in a round Circle made upon the Ground, laying one Hand upon ſome Aſhes brought thither for that purpoſe, and the other on their Breaſt, and uttering ſeveral Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to their Gods; after which, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd, on pain of Damnation, to make a true Anſwer to all ſuch Interrogatories as are put to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Linſchot</hi> makes the <hi>Idalcans,</hi> or Kings of <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> to be Subjects and Tributaries to the King of <hi>Narſinga;</hi> but <hi>Jarrick</hi> affirms them to be mortal Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Cuncan</hi> were formerly abſolute Lords of vaſt Territories, and ſubject to none; but about ſixty Years ago, in the time of King <hi>Mamedh Idelxa,</hi> Son to King <hi>Ibrahimxa,</hi> who <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. poſſeſt the Crown, in the twenty fourth Year of his Age, they were reduc'd under the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi>'s Juriſdiction: <hi>viz.</hi> when in King <hi>Mamedh Idelxa</hi>'s Minority (who Govern'd his Realm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guardianſhip of <hi>Chavas Chan</hi>) the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> aſſaulting thoſe of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Foot, and eighty thouſand Horſe, for their refuſing to pay him Tribute. After a long and bloody War, and the death of <hi>Chavas Chan,</hi> a Peace was concluded, Duke <hi>Muſtaff Chan</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> brought under ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> with Conditions to pay nine thouſand <hi>Pagods</hi> yearly for Tribute. But at preſent, as <hi>F. Bernier</hi> affirms, the King of <hi>Viſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour</hi> pays no Tribute to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf againſt all Attempts which he makes upon him: for though he be not ſo powerful as thoſe of <hi>Golconda</hi> oppoſe the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Forces, yet he hath this advantage, by reaſon of the remoteneſs of his Country from <hi>Dely</hi> and <hi>Agra,</hi> that the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi> makes not ſuch frequent Attempts on theſe Parts; beſides which, that part of the Country of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63517:180"/>
                  <hi>Viſiapour</hi> which lies next the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for an Army to approach, becauſe of the ſcarcity of Water and Proviſions, and the badneſs of the Ways. The Metropolis <hi>Viſiapour</hi> is alſo very ſtrong, ſituate in a dry barren Soil, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Fortreſſes, built on the circumjacent Mountains, which are moſt of them inacceſſible. Many <hi>Rajas</hi> alſo joyn with him for their own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Moreover he oftentimes receives private aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> who always keeps an Army ready on the Borders, to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> whenever he perceives him to be too much oppreſs'd by the <hi>Mogol.</hi> Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this State, as alſo that of <hi>Golconda,</hi> is much declin'd; for the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath taken <hi>Paranda</hi> from them, which is the Key of their Country, with the Magnificent City <hi>Bider,</hi> and ſome other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Places: But eſpecially becauſe of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two Kings; for the laſt King of <hi>Viſiapour</hi> dying without Iſſue-Male, the preſent King, who is a young Man, being brought up by the King of <hi>Golcondas</hi> Siſter, who took him for her Son, doth not acknowledge her Favours.</p>

                  <hi>Ibrahim Adil Sciah,</hi> who Reign'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. notwithſtanding the Countries of <hi>Cutb Sciah</hi> or the King of <hi>Golconda,</hi> and <hi>Nizam Sciah</hi> King of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> lay as Bulwarks between his Dominions and the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s, and upon occaſion was able to raiſe an Army of a hundred thouſand Men, ſtood never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in great fear of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> to whom though he paid conſiderable Tributes yearly, yet he was ſo ſlighted by the <hi>Mogol,</hi> that he ſent his Letters to him by a Common Soldier, or Slave, whom he was forc'd to meet with his whole Army, and conduct him in great Pomp to his Court, where he plac'd himſelf in a Chair of State prepar'd purpoſely for him, whilſt <hi>Adil Sciah</hi> was forc'd to ſtand in his Preſence, like a Slave: And when the Meſſenger had laid the Letter on a Carpet, he bow'd down to the Ground three times, according to the manner of the Country, before he durſt take it up.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ibrahim Adil Sciah</hi> is ſaid to have caus'd his own Son to be put to death, for perſuading him from paying the uſual Tribute to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> and counſelling him by force to free himſelf from that Slavery.</p>
               <p>The King now Reigning ſends oftentimes great Preſents to the <hi>Mogol. Anno</hi> 1656. in <hi>June,</hi> the King <hi>Sciah Sahep</hi> ſent a Preſent of ſeven <hi>Lak Penas,</hi> or Two hundred and eighty thouſand Pounds, to the <hi>Mogol</hi> Prince <hi>Oranchzef,</hi> (at preſent King) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Dautabake;</hi> who then accompanied with <hi>Mirſimula,</hi> lay with his Fathers Army on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> in a Province call'd <hi>Pretapapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venaſſars,</hi> and <hi>Collers</hi> or <hi>Coulys,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Rasboutes</hi> of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> pay Tribute to this King.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1656. the King of <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> call<hi>'d Adil Sciah,</hi> deceas'd; at which time <hi>Fettechan</hi> guarded the King's Palace; and <hi>Chan Channa</hi> coming with his whole Army near the Walls, deſir'd to know of <hi>Fettechan</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be convenient for him to bring the Army into the City, to prevent Inſurrections: Whereupon <hi>Fettechan</hi> reply'd, That he had taken upon him in <hi>Chan Channa</hi>'s abſence to Guard the Fort; and therefore he judg'd it beſt, for the ſafety of the Realm, to let <hi>Chan Channa</hi> come into the City: Whereupon he repair'd to <hi>Fettechan</hi> in the Palace, where conſulting together, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Crown the King's adopted Son, call'd <hi>Cha Chade,</hi> which was perform'd the ſame day, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the twenty fourth Year of his Age. This new King receiv'd the Name of <hi>Aly Adel Sciah,</hi> and was permitted to uſe the King's Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Seal. The right Coronation of their Kings is perform'd at <hi>Chirer Ridder,</hi> a principal Place in the Realm of <hi>Viſiapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the old King lay a dying, <hi>Chan Channa</hi> was ſent for to him by the Queen, who being come, the Queen told the King, <hi>Here is</hi> Chan Channa; but ſhe receiv'd no Anſwer. Soon after, <hi>Fettechan</hi> being alſo call'd thither, the Queen ſpoke to the King, ſaying, <hi>The Lord</hi> Fettechan <hi>is alſo here preſent;</hi> but the King not anſwering, lift up his Eyes and departed this life: which when <hi>Fettechan</hi> perceiv'd, he threw himſelf after many mournful Expreſſions on the Ground, and ſhew'd great ſigns of ſorrow.</p>
               <p>The young King was committed to the Care and Government of <hi>Chan Channa,</hi> being the ſecond Perſon in the Realm; whilſt <hi>Fettechan</hi> ſorrowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repair'd to his Houſe, where he mourn'd eight days for the King's death, no Man being able in that time to perſwade him to come to Court, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the new King had ſeveral times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him: But at laſt <hi>Chan Channa</hi> ſent him word, <hi>That it was then no time to mourn the King's death any longer; That there was a neceſſity for him to make his appearance before the new King; which if he again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to do, he ſhould be neceſſitated himſelf to fetch him, and to bring him before his Majeſty.</hi> Upon which Meſſage <hi>Fettechan</hi> made his appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and in all humility fell down at his Feet, but was immediately taken up and embrac'd by the new-Crown'd Prince. The Queen ſitting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll this while ſilent behind a Curtain, at laſt ſpoke thus to <hi>Fettechan: Why would you obſcure your ſelf in this juncture of time, when your Preſence is ſo much requir'd in all Buſineſs? 'Tis true, here wants no Counſel; but we cannot in theſe dangerous times repoſe any Confidence in them.</hi> Whereupon the young King added, <hi>You muſt baniſh the death of his deceaſed Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty out of your mind; I intend to promote you higher, and beſtow more Honor upon you than hitherto you have enjoy'd.</hi> Immediately after he gave him the Cane whereby he held his former Offices; which <hi>Fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> humbly receiving, was preſented by the King, as a Teſtimony of his Favor, with eight thouſand <hi>Penas,</hi> which he modeſtly refus'd, ſaying, That it was cuſtomary the Preſent ſhould be made to <hi>Chan Channa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among ſeveral other Perſons of Quality, the Lord <hi>Abdullachan</hi> came to Complement the King with a Preſent of nine thouſand <hi>Penas,</hi> and to wiſh him a long and proſperous Reign: But the King would not accept his Preſent, telling him, That in ſtead thereof, he ſhould encreaſe the number of his Horſe. The King likewiſe commanded all Officers that were unde his Subjection to appear at Court, charging them on forfeiture of a hundred thouſand <hi>Penas</hi> conſtantly to maintain a thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants were at this time in a great Conſternation, fearing to be ſurpriz'd by the <hi>Mogol</hi> Prince <hi>Oranchzef:</hi> But the King cauſing an Edict to be publiſh'd, commanded them to be at quiet, and encourag'd them with the hopes he had to lie down in a ſhort time with his Army before <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King profeſſes the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, as alſo the greateſt part of his Subjects; the reſt are <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> of which Opinion are the <hi>Canaryns</hi> of <hi>Goa,</hi> the <hi>Naires,</hi> and other <hi>Indians.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:63517:180"/>They obſerve ſeveral Faſts, and other Religious Ceremonies, like the <hi>Bramans. Linſchot</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a ſort of Religious Perſons among them, call'd <hi>Jogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In moſt Parts of the Country reſide <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who are permitted to Trade, and enjoy all Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, except Religion; yet nevertheleſs they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately make many Proſelites.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Decan, Viſiapour,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi> maintain the Religion eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> after the ſame manner with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and are therefore call'd <hi>Soanies;</hi> yet the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> is ſaid to encline to that of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But notwithſtanding they are all three <hi>Moors,</hi> and have inſtituted the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctrine in their Countries, yet they ſtill retain many Idolatrous Cuſtoms of the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Netherland Eaſt-India</hi> Company have a Free Trade through the whole Kingdom of <hi>Viſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> and Store-houſes in ſeveral Places, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whereof is at <hi>Wingurla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bay of <hi>Wingurla</hi> lies in 15 Degrees and 17 Minutes Northern Latitude, Northward from <hi>Goa,</hi> and three Leagues Southward from <hi>Ilhas Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madas,</hi> or <hi>The Burning Iſland.</hi> It hath a pretty large River, which runs ſome Leagues up into the Country, and is Navigable by ſmall Veſſels. At the entrance of this River ſeveral Streams of Freſh Water, which come down from the Mountains, fall into the Bay.</p>
               <p>The King allows the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which are confirm'd to them by a Letter dated the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1655. <hi>viz.</hi> That they may lawfully claim as their proper Goods all ſuch Commodities or Things whatſoever as ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be Stranded, coming out of any of their Ships caſt away upon his Coaſt: And they are likewiſe freed from all manner of Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as will appear more at large from the following <hi>Firman</hi> or Letter, written to the Lord General <hi>John Maetzuiker.</hi>
